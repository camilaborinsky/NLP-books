"Balzac, Honoré de","The Duke
Be careful what you say, for you waken in me terrible memories. And
your last word shows me that you will not shrink from causing a
scandal that will overwhelm all of us with shame. Shall we air in
public courts past occurrences which will show that I am not free from
reproach, while you are infamous? (He turns to Mademoiselle de
Vaudrey) She cannot have told you everything, dear aunt? She was in
love with Viscount Langeac; I knew it, and respected her love; I was
so young! The viscount came to me; being without hope of inheriting a
fortune, and the last representative of his house, he unselfishly
offered to give up Louise de Vaudrey. I trusted in their mutual
generosity, and accepted her as a pure woman from his hands. Ah! I
would have given my life for her, and I have proved it! The wretched
man performed prodigies of valor on the Tenth of August, and called
down upon himself the rage of the mob; I put him under the protection
of some of my people; he was, however, discovered and taken to the
Abbaye. As soon as I learned his predicament, I gave into the hands of
a certain Boulard all the money I had collected for our flight! I
induced Boulard to join the Septembrists in order to save the viscount
from death; I procured his escape! (To the duchess) He paid me back
well, did he not? I was young, madly in love, impetuous, yet I never
crushed the boy! You have to-day made me the same requital for my
pity, as your lover made for my trust in him. Well--things remain just
as they were twenty years ago excepting that the time for pity is
past. And I will repeat what I said to you then: Forget your son, and
he shall live."

received with one burst of acclamation. It has been the most popular of

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","I gazed at It from behind the curtain; Its eyes were wide open, and you
could see quite well that It was reflecting what It ought to do next. As
long as It did not come out I felt safe, for It could not see me.
Something funny seemed to strike It, and It laughed heartily. After a
time It tried to sit up. Fortunately Its head was so heavy that It
always lost its balance just as It seemed on the point of succeeding.
When It saw that It could not rise, It reflected again, and then all of
a sudden It put Its fist into Its mouth. I gazed in horror; soon only
the wrist was to be seen, and I saw that It would choke in another
minute. Just for a second I thought that I would let It do as It liked.
Then I cried out, ""Don't do that!"" and came out from behind the curtain.
Slowly It moved Its fist and there we were, looking at each other."

in a wood. That walking in a wood may be pleasant we do not deny, but
for our own part we avoid woods. More draughty places could not well be
imagined and many a person who has walked in a wood has had cause to
repent it for the rest of his life."

"Balzac, Honoré de","Yet in the midst of the disaster which the energy of government has
caused, but which the slightest sagacity in the world might have
prevented, the author has found some compensation in the testimony of
public sympathy which has been given him. M. Victor Hugo, among

pre-eminent in poetry; and the present writer has the greater
happiness in publishing the good will of M. Hugo, inasmuch as the
enemies of that distinguished man have no hesitation in blackening his
character."

Spaniards of Mexico, and his accent resembles Provencal, plus the
guttural intonation of the Moors.)"

"Austen, Jane",
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","What did you think of my doctor? You need not answer, for I know that
you disliked him. You and I were foes, and I was getting the worst of it
when he walked in and separated the combatants. His entrance was
pleasant to me. He showed a contempt for you that perhaps he did not
feel, and he used to take your chair. There were days when I wondered at
his audacity in doing that, but I liked it, too, and by and by I may
tell him why I often asked him to sit there. He was your doctor as well
as mine, and every time he said that I was a little better, I knew he
meant that you were a little weaker. You knew it, too, for I saw you
scowling after he had gone. My doctor is also my friend, and so, when I
am well, I say things against him behind his back. Then I see his
weaknesses and smile comfortably at them with his other friends--whom I
also discuss with him. But while you had me down he was another man. He
became, as it were, a foot taller, and I felt that he alone of men had
anything to say that was worth listening to. Other friends came to look
curiously at me and talk of politics, or Stanley, or on other frivolous
topics, but he spoke of my case, which was the great affair. I was not,
in my own mind, a patient for whom he was merely doing his best; I was
entirely in his hands. I was a business, and it rested with him whether
I was to be wound up or carried on as usual. I daresay I tried to be
pleasant to him--which is not my way--took his prescriptions as if I
rather enjoyed them, and held his thermometer in my mouth as though it
were a new kind of pipe. This was diplomacy. I have no real pleasure in
being fed with a spoon, nor do I intend in the future to smoke
thermometers. But I knew that I must pander to my doctor's weakness if
he was to take my side against you. Now that I am able to snap my
fingers at you I am looking forward to sneering once more at him. Just
at this moment, however, I would prefer to lay a sword flat upon his
shoulders, and say gratefully, ""Arise, Sir James."" He has altered the
faces of the various visitors who whispered to each other in my
presence, and nodded at me and said aloud that I would soon be right
again, and then said something else on the other side of the door. He
has opened my windows and set the sparrows a-chirping again, and he has
turned on the sunshine. Lastly, he has enabled me to call your cab. I am
done. Get out."
"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","""There's still plenty of water for the fish to swim in,"" observed the
Wizard as they rode along. ""They might like more but I'm sure they can
get along until we have raised the island and can fill up the lake

Glinda the Good, having decided to try her sorcery upon the abandoned
submarine, so that it would obey her commands, asked all of her party,
including the Skeezers, to withdraw from the shore of the lake to the
line of palm trees. She kept with her only the little Wizard of Oz, who
was her pupil and knew how to assist her in her magic rites. When they
two were alone beside the stranded boat, Glinda said to the Wizard:"

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","The boy who felt the disappointment most was, however, Urquhart himself.
He has never been a shining light in his classes, but that day he
stumbled over the Latin grammar at every step. From nine to ten he was
quiet and sullen, like one felled by the blow. It is, I believe,
notorious that in a fair fight Cocky Jones could not stand up before
Urquhart for a moment; yet, when Cocky kicked, Urquhart did not pursue
him. Between ten and eleven, Urquhart had a cynical countenance, which
implied that his faith in humanity was gone. By twelve he looked fierce,
as if he meant to write his benefactress, and give her a piece of his
mind. I saw him during the dinner-hour in hot controversy with Green and
Tosh, who were evidently saying that he had deceived them. From this
time he was pugnacious, like one determined to have it out with
somebody, and as he can use his fists, this mood made his companions
more respectful. Fleming Secundus is his particular chum, and after the
first bitterness of disappointment, Secundus returned to his allegiance.
He offered to mark Cocky Jones' face, I fancy, for I saw him in full
pursuit of Cocky in the playground. Having made it up, he and Urquhart
then discussed the matter calmly in a corner. They had several schemes
before them. One was to send the book back, saying that Urquhart had
already a copy of it."

Urquhart is a boy who lives in fear that his friends and relations will
send him the wrong birthday presents. Before his birthday came round
this year, he dropped them pretty broad hints as to the kind of gift he
would prefer, supposing they meant to remember the occasion. He worked
his people differently, according to the relationship that existed
between him and them. Thus to his mother he simply wrote, ""A fishing-rod
is what I want;"" but to an uncle, from whom there was only the
possibility of the present, he said, ""By the way, next Monday week is my
birthday, and my mother is going to send me a fishing-rod. Wouldn't it
be jolly rot if any other body sent me a fishing-rod?--Your affectionate

The one bumpy street of Springfield, despite its sparse crop of grass,
presents to this day a depressed appearance, a relic of the time when it
doubled up under a weight of thundering chariots. At the
well-remembered, notorious Queen's Head I stood in the gathering
gloaming, watching the road run yellow, until the last draggled hen had
spluttered through the pools to roost, and the mean row of whitewashed,
shrunken houses across the way had sunk into the sloppy ground, as they
have been doing slowly for half a century, or were carried away in a
rush of rain. Soaking weeds hung in lifeless bunches over the hedges of
spears that line the roads from Gretna; on sodden Canobie Lea, where
Lochinvar's steed would to-day have had to wade through yielding slush,
dirty piles of congealed snow were still reluctant to be gone; and
gnarled tree trunks, equally with palings that would have come out of
the ground with a sloppy gluck, showed a dank and cheerless green.
Yesterday the rooks dinned the air, and the parish of Gretna witnessed
such a marrying and giving in marriage as might have flung it back fifty
years. Elsewhere such a solemn cawing round the pulpit on the tree tops
would denote a court of justice, but in the vicinity of Springfield, it
may be presumed, the thoughts of the very rooks run on matrimony."

now rather mixed up in my mind, and I have no time to verify
anything--the first place I thought to leave my reputation in was a
volume of pot-boilers, which I wrote many years ago for an obscure
publication. At that time I was working hard for a reputation elsewhere,
and these short stories were only scribbled off for a livelihood. My
publisher heard of them recently, and offered me a hundred pounds for
liberty to republish them in book form. I pointed out to him that they
were very poor stuff, but he said that that had nothing to do with it; I
had a reputation now, and they would sell. With certain misgivings--for
I was not hardened yet--I accepted my publisher's terms, and the book
was soon out. The first book I published, which was much the best thing
I ever wrote, was only reviewed by three journals, of which two were
provincial weeklies. They said it showed signs of haste, though every
sentence in it was a labor. I sent copies of it to six or seven
distinguished literary men--some of whom are four-in-hand now--and two
of them acknowledged receipt of it, though neither said he had read it.
My pot-boilers, however, had not been out many weeks before the first
edition was exhausted. The book was reviewed everywhere, and, in nine
cases out of ten, enthusiastically lauded. It showed a distinct advance
on all my previous efforts. They were model stories of their kind. They
showed a mature hand. The wit was sparkling. There were pages in the
book that no one could read without emotion. In the old days I was paid
for these stories at the rate of five shillings the thousand words; but
they would make a reputation in themselves now. It has been thus all
along. I drop my reputation into every book I write now, but there is no
getting rid of it. The critics and the public return it to me,
remarking that it grows bigger."

releive our spirits, either by a lively song, a graceful Dance, or by
some smart bon-mot, and witty repartee. We are handsome my dear

prudent as tho’ 2 and 40. To convince you of this, I must inform you
that she has a very fine complexion and very pretty features, that she
already knows the two first letters in the Alphabet, and that she never
tears her frocks—. If I have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense
and Prudence, I have nothing more to urge in support of my assertion,
and you will therefore have no way of deciding the Affair but by coming
to Lesley-Castle, and by a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine
for yourself. Ah! my dear Freind, how happy should I be to see you

from School has separated me from you; that two such tender Hearts, so
closely linked together by the ties of simpathy and Freindship, should
be so widely removed from each other, is vastly moving. I live in

disposed to carry me there, and were your Mother to be there at the
same time. We might meet at Bath, at Tunbridge, or anywhere else
indeed, could we but be at the same place together. We have only to
hope that such a period may arrive. My Father does not return to us
till Autumn; my Brother will leave Scotland in a few Days; he is
impatient to travel. Mistaken Youth! He vainly flatters himself that
change of Air will heal the Wounds of a broken Heart! You will join

unfortunate one _Frederic Delamere_. The simile may be carried still
farther, and Elizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the
Emmeline of Delamere. It would be endless to recount the misfortunes of

beheaded on the 25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of

shewed him the advertisement. Robertus congratulated him and sent him
in his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling for
three days and six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest
and following a track which led by it’s side down a steep Hill over
which ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour.
Wilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without
receiving any answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door
which was fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room,
which he immediately perceived to be one of the two that were
unfurnished—From thence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A pair
of stairs that went out of it led him into a room above, no less
destitute, and these apartments he found composed the whole of the
House. He was by no means displeased with this discovery, as he had the
comfort of reflecting that he should not be obliged to lay out anything
on furniture himself—. He returned immediately to his Brother, who took
him the next day to every Shop in Town, and bought what ever was
requisite to furnish the two rooms and the Closet, In a few days
everything was completed, and Wilhelminus returned to take possession
of his Cottage. Robertus accompanied him, with his Lady the amiable
Cecilia and her two lovely Sisters Arabella and Marina to whom
Wilhelminus was tenderly attached, and a large number of Attendants.—An
ordinary Genius might probably have been embarrassed, in endeavouring
to accomodate so large a party, but Wilhelminus with admirable presence
of mind gave orders for the immediate erection of two noble Tents in an
open spot in the Forest adjoining to the house. Their Construction was
both simple and elegant—A couple of old blankets, each supported by
four sticks, gave a striking proof of that taste for architecture and

curiosity to see us (which must have been great to bring her more than
four hundred miles) being now perfectly gratified, she already begins

have befallen me had I not at length discerned thro’ the solemn Gloom
that surrounded me a distant light, which as I approached it, I
discovered to be the chearfull Blaze of your fire. Impelled by the

Arm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are

perusal of the following Pages your sensibility will be most severely
tried. Ah! what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which
I have already related to you, to the one I am now going to inform you
of. The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost
more than my gentle Nature could support, were trifles in comparison to
the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate. The morning after our
arrival at the Cottage, Sophia complained of a violent pain in her
delicate limbs, accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed
it to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the
Dew was falling the Evening before. This I feared was but too probably
the case; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should
have escaped the same indisposition, but by supposing that the bodily
Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so
effectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against
the chilling Damps of Night, whereas, Sophia lying totally inactive on
the ground must have been exposed to all their severity. I was most
seriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to
you, a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me, would in the End

"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)",Ozma had observed Lady Aurex closely and now asked her in a gentle tone:
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Who are my winter visitors? The chief of them is the doctor. We have no
doctor, of course, up here, and this one has to come twelve miles to us.
He is rather melancholy when we send for him; but he wastes no time in
coming, though he may not have had his clothes off for twenty-four
hours, and is well aware that we cannot pay big fees. Several times he
has had to remain with me all night, and once he was snowed up here for
a week. At times, too, he drives so far on his way to us and then has to
turn back because the gig sticks on the heavy roads. He is only a doctor
in a small country town, but I am elated when I see him, for he can tell
me whether the Government is still in power. Then I have the school
inspector once a year. The school inspector is always threatening to
change the date of inspection to summer, but he takes the town from
which the doctor comes in early spring, and finds it convenient to come
from there to here. Early spring is often winter with us, so that the
school inspector comes when there is usually snow on the ground or
threatening. The school is a mile away at another ""clachan,"" but the
inspector dines with me, and so does the schoolmaster. On these
occasions the schoolmaster is not such good company as at other times,
for he is anxious about his passes, and explains (as I think) more than
is necessary that regular attendance is out of the question in a place
like this. The inspector's visit is the time of my great annual
political debate, for the doctor calls politics ""fudge."" The inspector
and I are on different sides, however, and we go at each other hammer
and tongs, while the schoolmaster signs to me with his foot not to anger
the inspector."

"Balzac, Honoré de","Vautrin
I see you are doing well, my boy. You take little and often, you save,
you even have the honesty to lend a trifle at interest. That's all
right, but you cannot imagine what pleasure it gives me to see one of
my old acquaintances filling an honorable position. You have succeeded
in doing so; your faults are but negative and therefore half virtues.

nothing but dangers and struggles to interest me. Mine is the life of

your affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you
made me of our Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great
releif to me to write to you and as long as my Health and Spirits will
allow me, you will find me a very constant correspondent; I will not
say an entertaining one, for you know my situation suffciently not to
be ignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and I know my own Heart
too well not to be sensible that it would be unnatural. You must not
expect news for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted,
or in whose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect
scandal for by the same rule we are equally debarred either from
hearing or inventing it.—You must expect from me nothing but the
melancholy effusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the
Happiness it once enjoyed and which ill supports its present
wretchedness. The Possibility of being able to write, to speak, to you
of my lost Henry will be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I
know refuse to read what it will so much releive my Heart to write. I
once thought that to have what is in general called a Freind (I mean
one of my own sex to whom I might speak with less reserve than to any
other person) independant of my sister would never be an object of my
wishes, but how much was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by
two confidential correspondents of that sort, to supply the place of
one to me, and I hope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I
say that to have some kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to
my sorrows without endeavouring to console me was what I had for some
time wished for, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which
followed it and the particular affectionate attention you paid me
almost from the first, caused me to entertain the flattering Idea of
those attentions being improved on a closer acquaintance into a
Freindship which, if you were what my wishes formed you would be the
greatest Happiness I could be capable of enjoying. To find that such
Hopes are realised is a satisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is
now almost the only one I can ever experience.—I feel myself so languid
that I am sure were you with me you would oblige me to leave off
writing, and I cannot give you a greater proof of my affection for you
than by acting, as I know you would wish me to do, whether Absent or
Present. I am my dear Emmas sincere freind"

"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","""Let the cupboard alone,"" said the goldfish to him earnestly. ""You

are acting wisely and in the most effective manner. We did not know you
were so intelligent, or that Reera could be so easily deceived by you.
Continue as you have begun and try to persuade her to transform us. But
insist that we be given the forms of girls."""
"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","""That is a method we taught her,"" declared Aurah the Adept."
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Willum Lang's puckered face means business. He has been sent for by a
millworker from Langholm, who, having an hour to spare, thinks he may as
well drop in at the priest's and get spliced; or by an innocent visitor
wandering through the village in search of the mythical smithy; or by a
lawyer who shakes his finger threateningly at Willum (and might as well
have stayed at home with his mother). From the most distant shores
letters reach him regarding Gretna marriages, and if Willum dislikes
monotony he must be getting rather sick of the stereotyped beginning ""I
think your charges very extortionate."" The stereotyped ending ""but the
sum you asked for is enclosed,"" is another matter. It is generally about
midnight that the rustics of the county rattle Willum's door off its
snib and, bending over his bed, tell him to arise and marry them. His
hand is crossed with silver coin, for gone are the bridegrooms whose
gold dribbled in a glittering cascade from fat purses to a horny palm;
and then, with a sleepy neighbor, a cold hearth, and a rattling cynic of
a window for witnesses, he does the deed. Elsewhere I have used these
words to describe the scene:--""The room in which the Gretna Green
marriages have been celebrated for many years is a large rude kitchen,
but dimly lighted by a small 'bole' window of lumpy glass that faces an
ill-fitting back door. The draught generated between the two cuts the
spot where the couples stand, and must prove a godsend to flushed and
flurried bridegrooms. A bed--wooden and solid, ornamented with divers
shaped and divers colored clothes dependent from its woodwork like linen
hung on a line to dry--fills a lordly space. The monster fireplace
retreats bashfully before it into the opposite wall, and a grimy cracked
ceiling looks on a bumpy stone floor, from which a cleanly man could eat
his porridge. One shabby wall is happily hid by the drawers in which
Lang keeps his books; and against the head of the bed an apoplectic Mrs.
Langtry in a blue dress and yellow stockings, reminding the public that
Simon Lang's teas are the best, shudders at her reflection in the
looking-glass that dangles opposite her from a string."" The signboard
over a snuffy tavern that attempted to enter into rivalry with the
Queen's Head depicts the priest on his knees going through the church
marriage services, but the Langs have always kept their method of
performing the ceremony a secret between themselves and the interested
persons, and the artist in this case was doubtless drawing on his
imagination. The picture is discredited by the scene of the wedding
being made in a smithy, when it is notorious that the ""blacksmith"" has
cut the tobacco plug, and caught fish in the Solway, and worked at the
loom, the last, and the toll-bar, but never wielded Vulcan's hammer. The
popular term is thus a mystery, though a witness once explained, in a
trial, to Brougham, that Gretna marriages were a welding of heat. Now
the welding of heat is part of a blacksmith's functions."
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","The smith induced him to make another attempt, and this time he got as
far as ""Ladies and gentlemen, me and my wife----"" when the speech ended
prematurely in resounding chuckles. The last we saw of him, when the
carriage drove away, he was still grinning; but that, as he explained,
was because ""he had got Lizzie at last."" ""You'll be a good husband to
her, I hope,"" I said."

up. If there was a solid stone wall to keep them from reaching the
plain they would themselves be imprisoned by the wall. So they had to
leave some place to get around the wall, and, if the wall was visible,
all strangers or enemies would find the place to go around it and then
the wall would be useless. So the Flatheads cunningly made their wall
invisible, believing that everyone who saw the entrance to the mountain
would walk straight toward it, as we did, and find it impossible to go
any farther. I suppose the wall is really high and thick, and can't be

"Austen, Jane","I am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has
long disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to
require the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se’night
Matilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs
Kickabout’s; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable
young Man in the main, tho’ perhaps a little singular in his Taste—He
is in love with Matilda—. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the
Lady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when
my Attention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most
lovely of his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another
Gentleman and Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain
that on him depended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my
surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of Cleveland—I
instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the
acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the
gentleman and Lady who accompanied him. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe
handsome?) The elegant address of Mr Cleveland, his polished Manners
and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my attachment. He did not speak;
but I can imagine everything he would have said, had he opened his
Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated Understanding, the Noble
sentiments, and elegant Language which would have shone so conspicuous
in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The approach of Sir James Gower
(one of my too numerous admirers) prevented the Discovery of any such
Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we had never commenced, and
by attracting my attention to himself. But oh! how inferior are the
accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so greatly envied Rival!
Sir James is one of the most frequent of our Visitors, and is almost
always of our Parties. We have since often met Mr and Mrs Marlowe but
no Cleveland—he is always engaged some where else. Mrs Marlowe fatigues
me to Death every time I see her by her tiresome Conversations about
you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in the hope of seeing her
irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to Lady Flambeaus, who
is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will be Lady Lesley,
Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see little of Sir
George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my poor Fortune
where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who always makes
her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what Delightful
Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau’s! Yet I
wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she must be
sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little diminutive
figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that she can not
know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the most studied
apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how greatly
should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on our fine
majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea should
never have occurred to _her_. I am sure if I have reflected in this
manner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in
them such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother’s
Jewels too! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject—let me
entertain you with something more pleasing—Matilda had a letter this
morning from Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he
is at Naples has turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope’s
Bulls for annulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a
Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that
much the same sort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless
Louisa who is likewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon
to be married to a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished
merit. He says, that they are at present very good Freinds, have quite
forgiven all past errors and intend in future to be very good
Neighbours. He invites Matilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and
to bring him his little Louisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and
himself are equally desirous of beholding. As to our accepting his
invitation, it is at Present very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to
go without loss of time; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but
Matilda has some doubts of the Propriety of such a scheme—she owns it
would be very agreable. I am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father
desires us not to be in a hurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months
both he and Lady Lesley will do themselves the pleasure of attending
us. Lady Lesley says no, that nothing will ever tempt her to forego the
Amusements of Brighthelmstone for a Journey to Italy merely to see our
Brother. “No (says the disagreable Woman) I have once in my life been
fool enough to travel I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of
the Family, and I found it did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I
am so foolish again.” So says her Ladyship, but Sir George still
Perseveres in saying that perhaps in a month or two, they may accompany
us."

the submarine in which the Queen had come, but the Skeezers who were in

transformation had left them quite helpless. The under-water boat was
not operated by machinery, but by certain mystic words uttered by

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Montgomery, who was married years ago, is subject to headaches, and
formerly his only way of treating them was to lie in bed and read a
light novel. By the time the novel was finished, so, as a rule, was the
headache. This treatment rather interfered with his work, however, and
he tried various medicines which were guaranteed to cure rapidly. None
of them had the least result, until one day, some two months ago, good
fortune made him run against an old friend in Chambers street.
Montgomery having a headache, mentioned it, and his friend asked him if
he had tried the cio-root. The name even was unfamiliar to Montgomery,
but his friend spoke so enthusiastically of it that the headachy man
took a note of it. He was told that it had never been known to fail, and
the particular merit of it was that it drove the headache away in five
minutes. The proper dose to take was half an inch of the root, which was
to be sucked and eventually swallowed. Montgomery tried several chemists
in vain, for they had not heard of it, but at last he got it on George
IV. Bridge. He had so often carried home in triumph a ""certain cure,""
which was subsequently flung out at the window in disgust, that his wife
shook her head at the cio-root, and advised him not to be too hopeful.
However, the cio-root surpassed the fondest expectations. It completely
cured Montgomery in less than the five minutes. Several times he tried
it, and always with the same triumphant result. Having at last got a
drug to make an idol of, it is not perhaps to be wondered at that
Montgomery was full of gratitude. He kept a three pound tin of the
cio-root on his library-table, and the moment he felt a headache coming
on he said, ""Excuse me for one moment,"" and bit off half an inch of
cio-root."

couple whom it would almost have been a satisfaction to marry without a
fee (for the mere example of the thing) was that which raced from the
south of England with the lady's father. When they reached the top of a

one corner without seeing his steaming horse take another. Poor was the
fond lover (dark his prospects at Gretna Green in consequence) but brave
the maid, to whom her friends would insist on leaving money, which was
the cause of the whole to-do. The father, looking on the swain with
suspicious eye, took to dreaming of postillions, high-roads, blacksmiths

weltering in their blood was what first struck our Eyes—we
approached—they were Edward and Augustus—. Yes dearest Marianne they
were our Husbands. Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground—I screamed
and instantly ran mad—. We remained thus mutually deprived of our
senses, some minutes, and on regaining them were deprived of them
again. For an Hour and a Quarter did we continue in this unfortunate
situation—Sophia fainting every moment and I running mad as often. At
length a groan from the hapless Edward (who alone retained any share of
life) restored us to ourselves. Had we indeed before imagined that
either of them lived, we should have been more sparing of our Greif—but
as we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no more, we
knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about. No
sooner did we therefore hear my Edward’s groan than postponing our
lamentations for the present, we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and
kneeling on each side of him implored him not to die—. “Laura (said He
fixing his now languid Eyes on me) I fear I have been overturned.”"

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","I tried to lose my reputation in several other books of the same kind,
and always with the same result. Barnacles are nothing to a literary
reputation. Then I tried driving four-in-hand. There are now only five
or six of us who are four-in-hand novelists, but there are also
four-in-hand essayists, four-in-hand critics, etc., and we all work on
the same principle. Every one of us is trying to shake himself free of
his reputation. We novelists have, perhaps, the best chance, for there
are so few writers of fiction who have a reputation to lose that all the
magazine editors come to us for a serial tale. Next year I expect to be
six-in-hand, for the provincial weeklies want me as well as the
magazines. Any mere outsider would say I was safe to get rid of my
reputation this year, for I am almost beating the record in the effort.
A novelist of repute, who did not want to lose his reputation, would not
think of writing more than one story at a time, and he would take twelve
months, at least, to do it. That is not my way. Hitherto, though I have
been a member of the literary four-in-hand club, I have always been some
way ahead with at least two of my tales before they begin to appear in
serial form. You may give up the attempt to lose your reputation,
however, if you do not set about it more thoroughly than that; and the
four novels which I began in January in two English magazines, one
American magazine, and an illustrated paper, were all commenced in the
second week of December. (I had finished two novels in the last week of
November.) My original plan was to take them day about, doing about four
chapters of each a month; but to give my reputation a still better
chance of absconding, I now write them at any time. Now-a-days I would
never think of working out my plot beforehand. My thinking begins when I
take up my pen to write, and ends when I lay it down, or even before
that. In one of my stories this year I made my hero save the heroine
from a burning house. Had I done that in the old days they would have
ridiculed me, but now they say I reveal fresh talent in the delightful
way in which I re-tell a story that has no doubt been told before. The
beaten tracks, it is remarked, are the best to tread when the public has
such a charming guide as myself. My second novel opens with a shipwreck,
and I am nearly three chapters in getting my principal characters into
the boats. In my first books I used to guard carefully against the
introduction of material that did not advance the story, yet at that
time I was charged with ""padding."" In this story of the shipwreck there
is so much padding that I could blush--if I had not given all that
up--to think of it. Instead of confining myself to my own characters, I
describe all the passengers in the vessel--telling what they were like
in appearance, and what was their occupation, and what they were doing
there. Then, when the shipwreck comes, I drown them one by one. By one
means or another, I contrive to get six chapters out of that shipwreck,
which is followed by two chapters of agony in an open boat, which I
treat as if it were a novelty in fiction, and that, again, leads up to a
chapter on the uncertainty of life. Most flagrant padding of all is the
conversation. It always takes my characters at least two pages to say
anything. They approach the point in this fashion:"

his mind. When standing before him they are given to wabbling unsteadily
on their feet, and to taking his inquiry whether the maiden on their
right is goodly in their sight for an offer of another ""mutchkin:"" and
next morning they sometimes mistake somebody else's maiden for their
own. When one of the youth of the neighborhood takes to him a helpmate
at Springfield his friend often whiles away the time by courting
another, and when they return to Langholm things are sometimes a littled
mixed up. The priest, knowing what is expected of him, is generally able
when appealed to, to ""assign to each bridegroom his own;"" but one
shudders to think what complications may arise when Willum's eyes and

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","The ideal holiday in bed does not require the presence of a ministering
angel in the room all day. You frequently prefer to be alone, and point
out to your wife that you cannot have her trifling with her health for
your sake, and so she must go out for a walk. She is reluctant, but
finally goes, protesting that you are the most unselfish of men, and
only too good for her. This leaves a pleasant aroma behind it, for even
when lying in bed, we like to feel that we are uncommonly fine fellows.
After she has gone you get up cautiously, and, walking stealthily to the
wardrobe, produce from the pocket of your great coat a good novel. A
holiday in bed must be arranged for beforehand. With a gleam in your eye
you slip back to bed, double your pillow to make it higher, and begin to
read. You have only got to the fourth page, when you make a horrible
discovery--namely, that the book is not cut. An experienced
holiday-maker would have had it cut the night before, but this is your
first real holiday, or perhaps you have been thoughtless. In any case
you have now matter to think of. You are torn in two different ways.
There is your coat on the floor with a knife in it, but you cannot reach
the coat without getting up again. Ought you to get the knife or to give
up reading? Perhaps it takes a quarter of an hour to decide this
question, and you decide it by discovering a third course. Being a sort
of an invalid, you have certain privileges which would be denied you if
you were merely sitting in a chair in the agonies of neuralgia. One of
the glorious privileges of a holiday in bed is that you are entitled to
cut books with your fingers. So you cut the novel in this way, and read

"Austen, Jane","
You may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure
of Lord St Clair. “Ignoble Grand-sire!” exclaimed Sophia. “Unworthy
Grandfather!” said I, and instantly fainted in each other’s arms. How
long we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered we
found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, Philander, or the
Banknotes. As we were deploring our unhappy fate, the Door of the
Apartment opened and “Macdonald” was announced. He was Sophia’s cousin.
The haste with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt of
our Note, spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to
pronounce him at first sight, a tender and simpathetic Freind. Alas! he
little deserved the name—for though he told us that he was much
concerned at our Misfortunes, yet by his own account it appeared that
the perusal of them, had neither drawn from him a single sigh, nor
induced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive stars—. He told
Sophia that his Daughter depended on her returning with him to
Macdonald-Hall, and that as his Cousin’s freind he should be happy to
see me there also. To Macdonald-Hall, therefore we went, and were
received with great kindness by Janetta the Daughter of Macdonald, and
the Mistress of the Mansion. Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally
well disposed, endowed with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic
Disposition, she might, had these amiable qualities been properly
encouraged, have been an ornament to human Nature; but unfortunately
her Father possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted to admire so
promising a Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his
power to prevent it encreasing with her Years. He had actually so far
extinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail
on her to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation. They
were to be married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when
we arrived. _We_ soon saw through his character. He was just such a Man
as one might have expected to be the choice of Macdonald. They said he
was Sensible, well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge
of such trifles, but as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had
never read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least
resemblance to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could feel no
affection for him, or at least that she ought to feel none. The very
circumstance of his being her father’s choice too, was so much in his
disfavour, that had he been deserving her, in every other respect yet
_that_ of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the Eyes of
Janetta for rejecting him. These considerations we were determined to
represent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting with
the desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors
in the affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her
own opinion, and a suitable contempt of her father’s. We found her
indeed all that our warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no
difficulty to convince her that it was impossible she could love
Graham, or that it was her Duty to disobey her Father; the only thing
at which she rather seemed to hesitate was our assertion that she must
be attached to some other Person. For some time, she persevered in
declaring that she knew no other young man for whom she had the the
smallest Affection; but upon explaining the impossibility of such a
thing she said that she beleived she _did like_ Captain M’Kenrie better
than any one she knew besides. This confession satisfied us and after
having enumerated the good Qualities of M’Kenrie and assured her that
she was violently in love with him, we desired to know whether he had
ever in any wise declared his affection to her."

Glinda, the good Sorceress of Oz, sat in the grand court of her palace,

exquisitely polished. Fountains tinkled musically here and there; the
vast colonnade, open to the south, allowed the maidens, as they raised
their heads from their embroideries, to gaze upon a vista of rose-hued
fields and groves of trees bearing fruits or laden with sweet-scented
flowers. At times one of the girls would start a song, the others
joining in the chorus, or one would rise and dance, gracefully swaying

others, for I need not say that when he is called I am required too. To
wade through miles of snow is no great hardship to those who are
accustomed to it; but the heavy heart comes when one of my people is
seriously ill. Up here we have few slight illnesses. The doctor cannot
be summoned to attend them, and we usually ""fight away"" until the malady
has a heavy hold. Then the doctor comes, and though we are so scattered,

conclusion that they were negative. The cio-root did us no harm. The
taste was what one may imagine to be the taste of the root of any rotten
tree dipped in tar, which was subsequently allowed to dry. As we were
all of one mind on the subject, we insisted with Montgomery that the
cio-root was a fraud. Frequently we had such altercations with him on
the subject that we parted in sneers, and ultimately we said that it
would be best not to goad him too far; so we arranged merely to chaff
him about his faith in the root, and never went farther than insisting,
in a pleasant way, that he was cured, not by the cio-root, but by his
believing in it. Montgomery rejected this theory with indignation, but
we stuck to it and never doubted it. Events, nevertheless, will show you
that Montgomery was right and that we were wrong."

myself I realized that my only chance was to keep quiet. I tried to
think. The probability was that they were not far away, and if they
heard nothing for a quarter of an hour or so they might open the door
and let me out. So I stood still, with my eyes riveted on the thing
where It lay. It did not cry out again, and I hoped against hope that It
had not seen me. As I became accustomed to the room I heard It breathing
quite like a human being. This reassured me to some extent, for I saw
that It must be asleep. The question was--Might not the sleep be
disturbed at any moment, and in that case, what should I do? I
remembered the story of the man who met a wild beast in the jungle and
subjugated it by the power of the human eye. I thought I would try that.
All the time I kept glaring at It's lair (for I could not distinguish
itself), and the two things mixed themselves up in my mind till I
thought I was trying the experiment at that moment. Next it struck me
that the whole thing was perhaps a mistake. The servant had merely shown
me into the wrong room. Yes; but why had the door been locked? After
all, was I sure that it was locked? I crept closer to the door, and with
my eyes still fixed on the corner, put my hand gently--oh, so
gently!--on the handle. Softly I turned it round. I felt like a burglar.
The door would not open. Losing all self-control, I shook it; and then
again came that unnatural cry. I stood as if turned to stone, still
clutching the door handle, lest it should squeak if I let it go. Then I
listened for the breathing. In a few moments I heard It. Before It had
horrified me; now It was like sweet music, and I resumed breathing
myself. I kept close to the wall, ready for anything; and then I had a
strange notion. As It was asleep, why should I not creep forward and
have a look at It? I yielded to this impulse."

LETTER the FIFTH
From a YOUNG LADY very much in love to her Freind"
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Of course I had often seen Them before, but always with some responsible
person present, and never such a young one. I thought It would be done
up in clothes, but no, It lay loose, and without much on. I saw Its
hands and arms, and It had hair. It was sound asleep to all appearances,
but there was a queer smile upon Its face that I did not like. It
crossed my mind that It might be only shamming, so I looked away and
then turned sharply around to catch It. The smile was still there, but
It moved one of Its hands in a suspicious way. The more I looked the
more uncomfortable did that smile make me. There was something saturnine
about It, and It kept it up too long. I felt in my pocket hurriedly for
my watch, in case It should wake; but, with my usual ill-luck, I had
left it at the watchmaker's. If It had been older I should not have
minded so much, for I would have kept on asking what Its name was. But
this was such a very young one that It could not even have a name yet.
Presently I began to feel that It was lying too quietly. It is not Their
nature to be quiet for any length of time, and, for aught I knew, this
one might be ill. I believe I should have felt relieved if It had cried
out again. After thinking it over for some time I touched It to see if
It would move. It drew up one leg and pushed out a hand. Then I bit my
lips at my folly, for there was no saying what It might do next. I got
behind the curtain, and watched It anxiously through a chink. Except
that the smile became wickeder than ever, nothing happened. I was
wondering whether I should not risk pinching It, so as to make It scream
and bring somebody, when I heard an awful sound. Though I am only
twenty, I have had considerable experience of life, and I can safely say
that I never heard such a chuckle. It had wakened up and was laughing."

Beauty of three Ladies of whom you have heard so much. Now, as you are
too ill and too unhappy to be vain, I think I may venture to inform you
that I like none of their faces so well as I do your own. Yet they are
all handsome—Lady Lesley indeed I have seen before; her Daughters I
beleive would in general be said to have a finer face than her
Ladyship, and yet what with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a
little Affectation and a great deal of small-talk, (in each of which
she is superior to the young Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself
as many admirers as the more regular features of Matilda, and Margaret.
I am sure you will agree with me in saying that they can none of them
be of a proper size for real Beauty, when you know that two of them are
taller and the other shorter than ourselves. In spite of this Defect
(or rather by reason of it) there is something very noble and majestic
in the figures of the Miss Lesleys, and something agreably lively in
the appearance of their pretty little Mother-in-law. But tho’ one may
be majestic and the other lively, yet the faces of neither possess that
Bewitching sweetness of my Eloisas, which her present languor is so far

is very hard that a pretty woman is never to be told she is so by any
one of her own sex without that person’s being suspected to be either

The Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated

declared that he did _not_ kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to
beleive true; and if this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he
did not kill his Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of
York, why might not Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard. Whether
innocent or guilty, he did not reign long in peace, for Henry Tudor E.

"Austen, Jane","I _have_ made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my
Dear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were. I
reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a
second family, our fortunes must be considerably diminushed—that if his
Wife should be of an extravagant turn, she would encourage him to
persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little
encouragement would be necessary, and which has I fear already proved
but too detrimental to his health and fortune—that she would now become
Mistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother, and which Sir
George had always promised us—that if they did not come into Perthshire
I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my
Mother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit at the
head of her Father’s table—. These my dear Charlotte were the
melancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing
Susan’s letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she
had perused it likewise. The same ideas, the same fears, immediately
occupied her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most,
whether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own
Consequence. We both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is
handsome and what is your opinion of her; as you honour her with the
appellation of your freind, we flatter ourselves that she must be
amiable. My Brother is already in Paris. He intends to quit it in a few
Days, and to begin his route to Italy. He writes in a most chearfull
manner, says that the air of France has greatly recovered both his
Health and Spirits; that he has now entirely ceased to think of Louisa
with any degree either of Pity or Affection, that he even feels himself
obliged to her for her Elopement, as he thinks it very good fun to be
single again. By this, you may perceive that he has entirely regained
that chearful Gaiety, and sprightly Wit, for which he was once so
remarkable. When he first became acquainted with Louisa which was
little more than three years ago, he was one of the most lively, the
most agreable young Men of the age—. I beleive you never yet heard the
particulars of his first acquaintance with her. It commenced at our
cousin Colonel Drummond’s; at whose house in Cumberland he spent the
Christmas, in which he attained the age of two and twenty. Louisa
Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of Mrs. Drummond, who
dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty, left his only Child then
about eighteen to the protection of any of his Relations who would
protect her. Mrs. Drummond was the only one who found herself so
disposed—Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable Cottage in
Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from every pecuniary
Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant Enjoyment that
Money could purchase—. Louisa was naturally ill-tempered and Cunning;
but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition, under the
appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too well knew,
that to be married, would be the only chance she would have of not
being starved, and who flattered himself that with such an extroidinary
share of personal beauty, joined to a gentleness of Manners, and an
engaging address, she might stand a good chance of pleasing some young
Man who might afford to marry a girl without a Shilling. Louisa
perfectly entered into her father’s schemes and was determined to
forward them with all her care and attention. By dint of Perseverance
and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised her natural
disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to impose
upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with her
discovered her real Character. Such was Louisa when the hapless Lesley
first beheld her at Drummond-house. His heart which (to use your
favourite comparison) was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a
Whipt-syllabub, could not resist her attractions. In a very few Days,
he was falling in love, shortly after actually fell, and before he had
known her a Month, he had married her. My Father was at first highly
displeased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found
that they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the
match. The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the
bounty of his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely
sufficient to support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease. For the
first twelvemonth, no one could be happier than Lesley, and no one more
amiable to appearance than Louisa, and so plausibly did she act and so
cautiously behave that tho’ Matilda and I often spent several weeks
together with them, yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real
Disposition. After the birth of Louisa however, which one would have
thought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she had
so long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then
thought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did
indeed appear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she
seemed to take no pains to prevent that affection from ever
diminushing. Our visits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent
and by far less agreable than they used to be. Our absence was however
never either mentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of
young Danvers with whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at
one of the Universities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of
Matilda and your freind, tho’ there certainly never were pleasanter
girls than we are. You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial
happiness; I will not repeat it—. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I
have not yet mentioned anything of the matter, I hope you will do me
the justice to beleive that I _think_ and _feel_, a great deal for your
Sisters affliction. I do not doubt but that the healthy air of the
Bristol downs will intirely remove it, by erasing from her Mind the
remembrance of Henry. I am my dear Charlotte yrs ever"

Mortagne in order that you might appropriate the property entrusted to

Once a Munchkin farmer had stuffed an old suit of clothes with straw
and put stuffed boots on the feet and used a pair of stuffed cotton
gloves for hands. The head of the Scarecrow was a stuffed sack fastened
to the body, with eyes, nose, mouth and ears painted on the sack. When
a hat had been put on the head, the thing was a good imitation of a
man. The farmer placed the Scarecrow on a pole in his cornfield and it
came to life in a curious manner. Dorothy, who was passing by the
field, was hailed by the live Scarecrow and lifted him off his pole. He
then went with her to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz gave him

lake one night to dump it all in the water and poison the fish. It was
a clever idea, quite worthy of my dear wife, but the Skeezer Queen--a
young lady named Coo-ee-oh--hid on the bank of the lake and taking Rora
unawares, transformed her into a Golden Pig. The poison was spilled on
the ground and wicked Queen Coo-ee-oh, not content with her cruel
transformation, even took away my wife's four cans of brains, so she is
now a common grunting pig without even brains enough to know her own
name."""

disagreeable one, and so I like you, and bear with your grumpiness.

My Children begin now to claim all my attention in different Manner
from that in which they have been used to receive it, as they are now
arrived at that age when it is necessary for them in some measure to
become conversant with the World, My Augusta is 17 and her sister
scarcely a twelvemonth younger. I flatter myself that their education
has been such as will not disgrace their appearance in the World, and
that _they_ will not disgrace their Education I have every reason to
beleive. Indeed they are sweet Girls—. Sensible yet
unaffected—Accomplished yet Easy—. Lively yet Gentle—. As their
progress in every thing they have learnt has been always the same, I am
willing to forget the difference of age, and to introduce them together
into Public. This very Evening is fixed on as their first _entrée_ into
Life, as we are to drink tea with Mrs Cope and her Daughter. I am glad
that we are to meet no one, for my Girls sake, as it would be awkward
for them to enter too wide a Circle on the very first day. But we shall
proceed by degrees.—Tomorrow Mr Stanly’s family will drink tea with us,
and perhaps the Miss Phillips’s will meet them. On Tuesday we shall pay
Morning Visits—On Wednesday we are to dine at Westbrook. On Thursday we
have Company at home. On Friday we are to be at a Private Concert at
Sir John Wynna’s—and on Saturday we expect Miss Dawson to call in the
Morning—which will complete my Daughters Introduction into Life. How
they will bear so much dissipation I cannot imagine; of their spirits I
have no fear, I only dread their health."

season of the year, that we have actually seen but one genteel family
since we came. Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill
health of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may
imagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are of
course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost
every day, and dined with them yesterday. We spent a very pleasant Day,
and had a very good Dinner, tho’ to be sure the Veal was terribly
underdone, and the Curry had no seasoning. I could not help wishing all
dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it—. A brother of Mrs
Marlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking
young Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I tell
Eloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all seem
to relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and
Cleveland has a very good estate. Perhaps you may wonder that I do not
consider _myself_ as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but
to tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a
Wedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner, and therefore
while I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me, I shall never
think of doing it myself, as I very much suspect that I should not have
so much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner, as for dressing that

bring it to her, and when he obeyed she opened it and drew out a small
round mirror. On the surface of the glass she dusted a white powder and
then wiped it away with her handkerchief and looked in the mirror. It
reflected a part of the forest, and there, beneath a wide-spreading
tree, Button Bright was lying asleep. On one side of him crouched a
tiger, ready to spring; on the other side was a big gray wolf, its
bared fangs glistening in a wicked way."

and experimented in magical ways to bring it to the surface. She made
several such experiments, but all were failures. It seemed a simple

life at sea. It is pleasant to me to know that I am the kind of governor
Rawlins would have liked himself, had he required one. Peterkin's
mother, however, is the captain's favorite. She pretended to take the
young man's preference as a joke when her son informed her of it, but in
reality I am sure she felt greatly relieved. If Rawlins had objected to
us it would have put Peterkin in a very awkward position. As for Grizel,
the captain thinks her a very nice little girl, but ""for choice,"" he
says (according to Peterkin) ""give him a bigger woman."" Grizel was
greatly annoyed when he told her this, which much surprised him, for he
thought it quite as much as she had any right to expect. On the whole,
we were perhaps rather glad when Rawlins left, for it was somewhat
trying to live up to him. Peterkin's mother, too, has discovered that
her boy has become round-shouldered. It is believed that this is the

Why should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits? Why

experienced before? Can it be that I have a greater affection for
Willoughby than I had for his amiable predecessors? Or is it that our
feelings become more acute from being often wounded? I must suppose my
dear Belle that this is the Case, since I am not conscious of being
more sincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville, Fitzowen,
or either of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the most
lasting affection that ever warmed a Woman’s heart. Tell me then dear
Belle why I still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward, or why I
weep when I behold his Bride, for too surely this is the case—. My
Freinds are all alarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they
lament my want of spirits; they dread the effects of both. In hopes of
releiving my melancholy, by directing my thoughts to other objects,

us. Lady Bridget Darkwood and her sister-in-law, Miss Jane are expected

coming except curiosity. This attitude practically disarmed the witch

experience to them, they flung about restlessly, and probably shortened
their holiday. The proper thing is to take your holiday in bed with a
vague intention of getting up in another quarter of an hour. The real
pleasure of lying in bed after you are awake is largely due to the
feeling that you ought to get up. To take another quarter of an hour
then becomes a luxury. You are, in short, in the position of the man who
dined on larks. Had he seen the hundreds that were ready for him, all
set out on one monster dish, they would have turned his stomach; but
getting them two at a time, he went on eating till all the larks were

to Oz, unless in some way she left that fairyland or was spirited away
from it. But Dorothy was a mortal, nevertheless, and might possibly be
destroyed, or hidden where none of her friends could ever find her. She
could, for instance be cut into pieces, and the pieces, while still
alive and free from pain, could be widely scattered; or she might be
buried deep underground or ""destroyed"" in other ways by evil magicians,

They had been gone nearly a couple of Hours, before either Macdonald or
Graham had entertained any suspicion of the affair. And they might not
even then have suspected it, but for the following little Accident.
Sophia happening one day to open a private Drawer in Macdonald’s
Library with one of her own keys, discovered that it was the Place
where he kept his Papers of consequence and amongst them some bank
notes of considerable amount. This discovery she imparted to me; and
having agreed together that it would be a proper treatment of so vile a
Wretch as Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly
gained, it was determined that the next time we should either of us
happen to go that way, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from
the drawer. This well meant Plan we had often successfully put in
Execution; but alas! on the very day of Janetta’s Escape, as Sophia was
majestically removing the 5th Bank-note from the Drawer to her own
purse, she was suddenly most impertinently interrupted in her
employment by the entrance of Macdonald himself, in a most abrupt and
precipitate Manner. Sophia (who though naturally all winning sweetness
could when occasions demanded it call forth the Dignity of her sex)
instantly put on a most forbidding look, and darting an angry frown on
the undaunted culprit, demanded in a haughty tone of voice “Wherefore
her retirement was thus insolently broken in on?” The unblushing
Macdonald, without even endeavouring to exculpate himself from the
crime he was charged with, meanly endeavoured to reproach Sophia with
ignobly defrauding him of his money... The dignity of Sophia was
wounded; “Wretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing the Bank-note in the
Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act, of which the bare idea
makes me blush?” The base wretch was still unconvinced and continued to
upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such opprobious Language, that at
length he so greatly provoked the gentle sweetness of her Nature, as to
induce her to revenge herself on him by informing him of Janetta’s
Elopement, and of the active Part we had both taken in the affair. At
this period of their Quarrel I entered the Library and was as you may

Peterkin frowned, however, at this show of affection, and with a red
face looked at the captain to see how he took it. With much good taste,
Peterkin said nothing about this ""fuss"" on the doorstep, and I concluded
that he would let it slide. It has so far been a characteristic of that
boy that he can let anything which is disagreeable escape his memory.

wrath to pour it out upon his sister. Finding her alone in the course of

thing she had done, making a fool of him before another fellow. Asked
boldly--for Grizel can be freezing on occasion not only to her own

inquired hotly if she was going to pretend that she had not kissed him
in Rawlins' presence. Grizel replied that if Rawlins thought anything of
that he was a nasty boy; at which Peterkin echoed ""boy"" with a grim
laugh, and said he only hoped she would see the captain some day when
the ground suited his style of bowling. Grizel replied contemptuously
that the time would come when both Peterkin and his disagreeable friend

Friday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning, and with her, her sweet
sister Miss Jane—. Although I have been acquainted with this charming
Woman above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she
is. She is now about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is
more blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her,
the moment she entered the house, and she appeared equally pleased with
me, attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day. There is
something so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more
than Mortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I
could not help telling her how much she engaged my admiration—. “Oh!
Miss Jane (said I)—and stopped from an inability at the moment of
expressing myself as I could wish—Oh! Miss Jane—(I repeated)—I could
not think of words to suit my feelings—She seemed waiting for my
speech—. I was confused—distressed—my thoughts were bewildered—and I
could only add—“How do you do?” She saw and felt for my Embarrassment
and with admirable presence of mind releived me from it by saying—“My
dear Sophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself—I will turn the
Conversation without appearing to notice it. “Oh! how I loved her for
her kindness!” Do you ride as much as you used to do?” said she—. “I am
advised to ride by my Physician. We have delightful Rides round us, I
have a Charming horse, am uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied I
quite recovered from my Confusion, and in short I ride a great deal.”
“You are in the right my Love,” said she. Then repeating the following

I have consented to fight with an unknown man, but the greatness of

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","And so on. There is so much of this kind of thing in my recent novels
that if all the lines of it were placed on end I daresay they would
reach round the world. Yet I am never charged with padding now. My
writing is said to be beautifully lucid. My shipwreck has made several
intelligent critics ask if I have ever been a sailor, though I don't
mind saying here, that like Douglas Jerrold, I only dote upon the sea
from the beach. I have been to Dover, but no further, and you will find
my shipwreck told (more briefly) in Marryatt. I dashed it off less than
two months ago, but for the life of me I could not say whether my ship
was scuttled, or went on fire, or sprang a leak. Henceforth I shall only
refer to it as the shipwreck, and my memory will do all that is required
of it if it prevents my mistaking the novel that contains the shipwreck.
Even if I did that, however, I know from experience that my reputation
would be as safe as the lives of my leading characters. I began my
third novel, meaning to make my hero something of a coward, but though I
worked him out after that patter for a time, I have changed my plan. He
is to be peculiarly heroic henceforth. This will not lose me my
reputation. It will be said of my hero that he is drawn with no ordinary
skill, and that the author sees the two-sideness of every man's
character. As for the fourth story, it is the second one over again,
with the shipwreck omitted. One night when I did not have a chapter to
write--a rare thing with me--I read over the first part of this fourth
tale--another rare thing--and found it so slip-shod as to be
ungrammatical. The second chapter is entirely taken up with a
disquisition on bald heads, but the humor of it will be said to increase
my reputation. Sometimes when I become despondent of ever losing my
reputation, I think of taking a whole year to write one novel in, just
to see what I really could do. I wonder whether the indulgent public
would notice any difference? Perhaps I could not write carefully now if
I tried. The small section of the public that guesses which of the
four-in-hand writers I am may think for a moment that this story of how
I tried in vain to lose my reputation will help me toward the goal.
They are wrong, however. The public will stand anything from us now--or
they would get something better."

to come nearer. This was even more alarming than my worst fears. I shook
my head and then my fist at It, but It only laughed the more. In the end
I got so fearful that I went down on my hands and knees, to get out of
Its sight. Then It began to scream. However, I did not get up. When they

SCENE FOURTH."
"Austen, Jane","I have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking
you my dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should
not have deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the
last five weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements
for my sisters wedding, as to allow me no time to devote either to you
or myself. And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the
Match is broke off, and all my Labour thrown away. Imagine how great
the Dissapointment must be to me, when you consider that after having
laboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get the Wedding dinner
ready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef, Broiled Mutton,
and Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the
Honey-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been
Roasting, Broiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose.
Indeed my dear Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to
what I experienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in
the store-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me
that Hervey had been thrown from his Horse, had fractured his Scull and
was pronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger. “Good
God! (said I) you dont say so? Why what in the name of Heaven will
become of all the Victuals! We shall never be able to eat it while it
is good. However, we’ll call in the Surgeon to help us. I shall be able
to manage the Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and You and
the Doctor must finish the rest.” Here I was interrupted, by seeing my
poor Sister fall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests,
where we keep our Table linen. I immediately called my Mother and the
Maids, and at last we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she
was sensible, she expressed a determination of going instantly to
Henry, and was so wildly bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest
Difficulty in the World to prevent her putting it in execution; at last
however more by Force than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her
room; we laid her upon the Bed, and she continued for some Hours in the
most dreadful Convulsions. My Mother and I continued in the room with
her, and when any intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would
allow us, we joined in heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in
our provisions which this Event must occasion, and in concerting some
plan for getting rid of them. We agreed that the best thing we could do
was to begin eating them immediately, and accordingly we ordered up the
cold Ham and Fowls, and instantly began our Devouring Plan on them with
great Alacrity. We would have persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of
a Chicken, but she would not be persuaded. She was however much quieter
than she had been; the convulsions she had before suffered having given
way to an almost perfect Insensibility. We endeavoured to rouse her by
every means in our power, but to no purpose. I talked to her of Henry.
“Dear Eloisa (said I) there’s no occasion for your crying so much about
such a trifle. (for I was willing to make light of it in order to
comfort her) I beg you would not mind it—You see it does not vex me in
the least; though perhaps I may suffer most from it after all; for I
shall not only be obliged to eat up all the Victuals I have dressed
already, but must if Henry should recover (which however is not very
likely) dress as much for you again; or should he die (as I suppose he
will) I shall still have to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry
any one else. So you see that tho’ perhaps for the present it may
afflict you to think of Henry’s sufferings, Yet I dare say he’ll die
soon, and then his pain will be over and you will be easy, whereas my
Trouble will last much longer for work as hard as I may, I am certain
that the pantry cannot be cleared in less than a fortnight.” Thus I did
all in my power to console her, but without any effect, and at last as
I saw that she did not seem to listen to me, I said no more, but
leaving her with my Mother I took down the remains of The Ham and
Chicken, and sent William to ask how Henry did. He was not expected to
live many Hours; he died the same day. We took all possible care to
break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the tenderest manner; yet in
spite of every precaution, her sufferings on hearing it were too
violent for her reason, and she continued for many hours in a high
Delirium. She is still extremely ill, and her Physicians are greatly
afraid of her going into a Decline. We are therefore preparing for
Bristol, where we mean to be in the course of the next week. And now my
dear Margaret let me talk a little of your affairs; and in the first
place I must inform you that it is confidently reported, your Father is
going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so unpleasing a
report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I have written
to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning it, which as
she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give me. I know not
who is the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely right in the
resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps contribute to
obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events, which have
lately so much afflicted him—I am happy to find that tho’ secluded from
all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or unhappy—that you may
never know what it is to, be either is the wish of your sincerely
affectionate"

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","About the year 1826, the high road to Scotland ran away from
Springfield. Weeds soon afterwards sprouted in the street, and though
the place's reputation died hard, its back had been broken. Runaways
skurried by oblivious of its existence, and at a convenient point on the
new road shrewd John Linton dropped Gretna Hall. Springfield's
convenient situation had been its sole recommendation, and when it lost
that it was stranded. The first entry in the Langs' books dates back to
1771, when Joseph Paisley represented the priesthood, but the impetus to
Gretna marriages had been given by the passing of Lord Hardwicke's act,
a score of years before. Legend speaks of a Solway fisherman who taught
tobacconist Paisley the business. Prior to 1754, when the law put its
foot down on all unions not celebrated by ministers of the Church of
England, there had been no need to resort to Scotland, for the chaplains
of the fleet were anticipating the priests of Gretna Green, and doing a
roaring trade. Broadly speaking, it was as easy between the Reformation
and 1745 to get married in the one country as in the other. The Marriage
Act changed all that. It did a real injustice to non-members of the
Established Church, and only cured the disease in one place to let it
break out in another. Lord Hardwicke might have been a local member of
Parliament, pushing a bill through the House ""for the promotion of
Larceny and Rowdyism at Gretna Green."" For the greater part of a
century, there was a whirling of coaches and a clattering of horses
across the border, after which came marriage in England before a
registrar, and an amendment of the Scotch law that required residence
north of the Sark, on the part of one of the parties, for twenty-one
days before the ceremony took place. After that the romance of Gretna
Green was as a tale that was told. The latter half of the last century,
and the first twenty years of this, were thus the palmy days of
Springfield, for after Gretna Hall hung out its signboard, the Langs
were oftener seen at the ""big house"" than in the double-windowed parlor
of the Queen's Head."
"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","But instead of ""leading on,"" the platform of marble began to rise,

all means.” “Shall we go now?” (said my Mother,) “The sooner the
better.” (answered he.) “Oh! let no time be lost” (cried I.)"
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","The day that Gretna Hall became an inn, its landlord felt himself called
to the priesthood, and as long as he and his son remained above ground,
marriage was the heaviest item in their bills. But when Gretna knew them
no more, Jardine's chance had come. Even at Springfield the line has
always been drawn at female priests, and from the ""big house"" used to
come frequent messages to the shoemaker with its mistress's compliments
and would he step up at once. The old gentleman is a bit of a dandy in
his way, and it is pleasant to know that Nature herself gave him on
those occasions a hint when it was time to dress. The rush for him down
dark fields and across the Headless Cross was in a flurry of haste, but
in the still night the rumble of a distant coach had been borne to him
over the howes and meadows, and Jardine knew what that meant as well as
the marriage service. Sometimes the coaches came round by Springfield,
when the hall was full, and there was a tumbling out and in again by
trembling runaways at the rival inns. Even the taverns have run couples,
and up and down the sleety street horses pranced and panted in search of
an idle priest. Jardine remembers one such nightmare time when the
clatter of a pursuing vehicle came nearer and nearer, and a sweet young
lady in the Queen's Head flung up her hands to heaven. Crash went her
true lovers' fist through a pane of glass to awaken the street (which
always slept with one eye open) with the hoarse wail, ""A hundred pounds
to the man that marries me!"" But big as was the bribe, the speed of the
pursuers was greater, and the maiden's father looking in at the inn at
an inconvenient moment called her away to fulfill another engagement.
The Solway lies white from Gretna Hall like a sheet of mourning paper,
between edges of black trees and hills. The famous long, low room still
looks out on an ageing park, but they are only ghosts that join hands
in it now, and it is a clinging to old days that makes the curious moon
peep beneath the blind. The priest and the unbidden witness still are,
but brides and bridegrooms come no more. To the days of his youth
Jardine had to fling back his memory to recall the gravel springing from
the wheels of Wakefield's flying chariot. The story is told in
Hutchinson's _Chronicles of Gretna Green_, the first volume of which
leads up to but does not broach the subject, and is common property at
Springfield. The adventurer's dupe was an affectionate school-girl on
whose feelings he worked by representing himself as the one friend who
could save her father from ruin and disgrace. The supposed bankrupt was
said to have taken flight to Scotland, and the girl of fifteen, jumping
into Wakefield's coach at Liverpool, started with him in pursuit. A more
graceless rascal never was, for at Carlisle the adventurer swore that he
had talked with Miss Turner's father in an hotel where he was lying
hidden from the sheriff's officers, and that the fugitive's wish was
that she should, without delay, accept Mr. Wakefield's hand. The poor
lassie, frantic with anxiety, was completely gulled, and on the eighth
of March, 1826, Wakefield's coach drew up at Gretna Hall. Too late came
the pursuit to stop the marriage, but the runaways were traced to
France, and the law soon had the husband of a week by the heels. He had
trusted, like all his brotherhood, to the lady's father making the best
of it; and so, perhaps, he did; for the adventurer's address for the
next three years was--Newgate, London."

The following is a word-puzzle. It narrates the adventures of a
four-in-hand novelist while trying to lose his reputation. Competitors
do not require to be told that a four-in-hand novelist is a writer of
fiction who keeps four serial tales running abreast in the magazines.
The names of specimen four-in-hand novelists will recur readily to every

_Rule I._--_It is not good form to climb onto the table._ There is no
doubt a great temptation to this. When you are struggling with a duck,
and he wobbles over just as you think you have him, you forget yourself.
The common plan is not to leap upon the table all at once. This is the
more usual process: The carver begins to carve sitting. By-and-by he is
on his feet, and his brow is contracted. His face approaches the fowl,
as if he wanted to inquire within about everything except that the duck
is reluctant to yield any of its portions. One of his feet climbs onto
his chair, then the other. His knees are now resting against the table,
and, in his excitement, he, so to speak, flings himself upon the fowl.

It was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad
Ministers—Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have committed
such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men connived
at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by many people
been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis Walsingham,
and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State were
deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh! how blinded such
writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit despised,
neglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they
reflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their
Country and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining
for the space of nineteen years, a _Woman_ who if the claims of
Relationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who
condescended to place confidence in her, had every reason to expect
assistance and protection; and at length in allowing Elizabeth to bring
this amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and scandalous Death. Can
any one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot, this everlasting
blot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any praise to
Lord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham? Oh! what must this bewitching
Princess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose only
ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was
abandoned by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and
vilified by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when
informed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore it
with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her
Religion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she was
doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from conscious
Innocence. And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible that some
hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that
steadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so much
credit? But this is a striking proof of _their_ narrow souls and
prejudiced Judgements who accuse her. She was executed in the Great
Hall at Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of
February 1586—to the everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers,
and of England in general. It may not be unnecessary before I entirely
conclude my account of this ill-fated Queen, to observe that she had
been accused of several crimes during the time of her reigning in
Scotland, of which I now most seriously do assure my Reader that she
was entirely innocent; having never been guilty of anything more than
Imprudencies into which she was betrayed by the openness of her Heart,
her Youth, and her Education. Having I trust by this assurance entirely
done away every Suspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in
the Reader’s mind, from what other Historians have written of her, I
shall proceed to mention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth’s
reign. It was about this time that Sir Francis Drake the first English
Navigator who sailed round the World, lived, to be the ornament of his
Country and his profession. Yet great as he was, and justly celebrated
as a sailor, I cannot help foreseeing that he will be equalled in this
or the next Century by one who tho’ now but young, already promises to
answer all the ardent and sanguine expectations of his Relations and
Freinds, amongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom this work is
dedicated, and my no less amiable self."

eager to fight the Flatheads, and Ozma's object in coming here was to
prevent fighting and induce the two quarrelsome neighbors to make

As this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father’s
death, he was considered by many people as too young to govern, and the
late King happening to be of the same opinion, his mother’s Brother the
Duke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority.
This Man was on the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat
of a favourite with me, tho’ I would by no means pretend to affirm that
he was equal to those first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or
Gilpin. He was beheaded, of which he might with reason have been proud,
had he known that such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but as
it was impossible that he should be conscious of what had never
happened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with
the manner of it. After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had the
care of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of both so
well that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his daughter in law
the Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading Greek.
Whether she really understood that language or whether such a study
proceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was
always rather remarkable, is uncertain. Whatever might be the cause,
she preserved the same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what
was generally esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for she
declared herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while
conducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another
in Greek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally passing
that way."

This Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of
York, by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right
inferior to hers, tho’ he pretended to the contrary. By this Marriage
he had two sons and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was
married to the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being
grandmother to one of the first Characters in the World. But of _her_,
I shall have occasion to speak more at large in future. The youngest,
Mary, married first the King of France and secondly the D. of Suffolk,
by whom she had one daughter, afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey,
who tho’ inferior to her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an
amiable young woman and famous for reading Greek while other people
were hunting. It was in the reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck
and Lambert Simnel before mentioned made their appearance, the former
of whom was set in the stocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was
beheaded with the Earl of Warwick, and the latter was taken into the

Elizabeth."

Chapter Three"
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","The present landlord of this hostelry, a lightsome host, troubled with
corns, who passes much of his time with a knife in one hand and his big
toe in the other, is nephew of that Beattie who saw his way to bed by
the gleam of post-boy's lamps, and spent his days unsnibbing the Queen's
Head door to let runaways in, and barring it to keep their pursuers out.
Much depends on habit, and Beattie slept most soundly to the drone of
the priest in his parlor, and the rub-a-dub of baffled parents on his
window-sills. His nephew, also a Beattie, brings his knife with him into
the immortal room, where peers of the realm have mated with country
wenches, and fine ladies have promised to obey their father's
stable-boys, and two lord chancellors of England with a hundred others
have blossomed into husbands, and one wedding was celebrated of which
neither Beattie nor the world takes any account. There are half a dozen
tongues in the inn--itself a corpse now that wearily awaits
interment--to show you where Lord Erskine gambolled in a tablecloth,
while David Lang united him in the bonds of matrimony with his
housekeeper, Sarah Buck. There is the table at which he composed some
Latin doggerel in honor of the event, and the doubtful signature on a
cracked pane of glass. A strange group they must have made--the gaping
landlord at the door, Mrs. Buck, the superstitious, with all her
children in her arms, David Lang rebuking the lord chancellor for posing
in the lady's bonnet, Erskine in his tablecloth skipping around the
low-roofed room in answer, and Christina Johnstone, the female witness,
thinking sadly that his lordship might have known better. Here, too,
Lord Eldon galloped one day with his ""beloved Bessy;"" and it is not
uninteresting to note that though he came into the world eighteen months
after Lord Erskine, he paid Gretna Green a business visit nearly fifty
years before him. Lang's books are a veritable magic-lantern, and the
Queen's Head the sheet on which he casts his figures. The slides change.
Joseph Paisley sees his shrewd assistant, David Lang, marry his
granddaughter, and dies characteristically across the way. David has his
day, and Simon, his son, succeeds him; and in the meantime many a
memorable figure glides shadow-like across the screen. The youth with
his heart in his mouth is Lord George Lambton. It is an Earl of
Westmoreland that plants his shoulders against the door, and tells the
priest to hurry. The foot that drums on the floor is Lady Alicia
Parson's. A son of Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough makes way for his own
son; a daughter follows in the very footsteps of her father, only a few
hours between them. A daughter of Archdeacon Philpot arrives at four
o'clock in the morning, and her companion forgets to grease the
landlord's hand. The Hon. Charles Law just misses Lord Deerhurst. There
are ghosts in cocked hats, and naval and military uniform, in muslin,
broadcloth, tweed and velvet, gold lace and pigskin; swords flash,
pistols smoke, steaming horses bear bleeding riders out of sight, and a
thousand forms flit weird and shadowy through the stifling room."

"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","Usually when Dorothy started on a journey of exploration or adventure,
she carried with her a basket of food, and other things that a traveler
in a strange country might require, but to go away with Ozma was quite
a different thing, as experience had taught her. The fairy Ruler of Oz
only needed her silver wand--tipped at one end with a great sparkling
emerald--to provide through its magic all that they might need.
Therefore Ozma, having halted with her companion and selected a smooth,
grassy spot on the plain, waved her wand in graceful curves and chanted
some mystic words in her sweet voice, and in an instant a handsome tent
appeared before them. The canvas was striped purple and white, and from
the center pole fluttered the royal banner of Oz."
"Austen, Jane","Such is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while
riding in her Ladyship’s Coach—I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother
is always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my
way in the world. She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady
Greville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her
House, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of
being abused for my Poverty while I am in them.—When we arrived at
Ashburnham, it was nearly ten o’clock, which was an hour and a half
later than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too
fashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The Dancing
however was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been
long in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just
as we were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got
his white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean
time the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room
went exactly before me—She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me
though there were several people close to us,"

steeply behind the farm-house, and leaning from the bank was an old
apple-tree, shading a spring that trickled out from the rocks and
dropped into a mossy trough below. Up the tree had grown a wild

In a few days, following upon years of subterranean labors, I shall
have won for Raoul a commanding position; it must be made sure to him.
Lafouraille and Philosopher will be necessary to me in the country
where I am to give him a family. Ah, this love! It has put out of the
question the life I had destined him to. I wished to win for him a
solitary glory, to see him conquering for me and under my direction,
the world which I am forbidden to enter. Raoul is not only the child
of my intellect and of my malice, he is also my instrument of revenge.
These fellows of mine cannot understand these sentiments; they are
happy; they have never fallen, not they! They were born criminals. But
I have attempted to raise myself. Yet though a man can raise himself
in the eyes of God, he can never do so in the eyes of the world.
People tell you to repent, and then refuse to pardon. Men possess in
their dealings with each other the instincts of savage animals. Once
wounded, one is down-trodden by his fellows. Moreover, to ask the
protection of a world whose laws you have trampled under foot is like
returning to a house which you have burnt and whose roof would fall
and crush you. I have well polished and perfected the magnetic
instrument of my domination. Raoul was brave, he would have sacrificed
his life, like a fool; I had to make him cold and domineering, and to
dispel from his mind, one by one, his exalted ideas of life; to render
him suspicious and tricky as--an old bill-broker, while all the while
he knew not who I was. And at this moment love has broken down the
whole scaffolding. He should have been great; now, he can only be
happy. I shall therefore retire to live in a corner at the height of
his prosperity; his happiness will have been my work. For two days I
have been asking myself whether it would not be better that the
Princesse d'Arjos should die of some ailment--say brain fever. It's

It is a month to day since I first beheld my lovely Henrietta, and the
sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in a manner becoming the
day—by writing to her. Never shall I forget the moment when her
Beauties first broke on my sight—No time as you well know can erase it
from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady Scudamore to live
within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely Creature first
entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight of you was
like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started—I gazed at her with
admiration—She appeared every moment more Charming, and the unfortunate
Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time to look
about me. Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an happiness
for which I cannot be too grateful. “What said he to himself is
Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta? Enviable Mortal! and may he pine
for her who is the object of universal admiration, who is adored by a
Colonel, and toasted by a Baronet! Adorable Henrietta how beautiful you
are! I declare you are quite divine! You are more than Mortal. You are
an Angel. You are Venus herself. In short Madam you are the prettiest
Girl I ever saw in my Life—and her Beauty is encreased in her Musgroves
Eyes, by permitting him to love her and allowing me to hope. And ah!
Angelic Miss Henrietta Heaven is my witness how ardently I do hope for
the death of your villanous Uncle and his abandoned Wife, since my fair
one will not consent to be mine till their decease has placed her in
affluence above what my fortune can procure—. Though it is an
improvable Estate—. Cruel Henrietta to persist in such a resolution! I
am at Present with my sister where I mean to continue till my own house
which tho’ an excellent one is at Present somewhat out of repair, is
ready to receive me. Amiable princess of my Heart farewell—Of that
Heart which trembles while it signs itself Your most ardent Admirer and
devoted humble servt."

was too thin and plain of feature to be pretty. But evidently Queen

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Though Grizel was thus a little prejudiced against the captain, he had
not been a day in the house when we began to feel the honor that his
visit conferred on us. He was modest almost to the verge of shyness; but
it was the modesty that is worn by a man who knows he can afford it.
While Peterkin was there Rawlins had no need to boast, for Peterkin did
the boasting for him. When, however, the captain exerted himself to
talk, Peterkin was contented to retire into the shade and gaze at him.
He would look at all of us from his seat in the background, and note how
Rawlins was striking us. Peterkin's face as he gazed upon that of the
captain went far beyond the rapture of a lover singing to his mistress's
eyebrow. He fetched and carried for him, anticipated his wants as if
Rawlins were an invalid, and bore his rebukes meekly. When Rawlins
thought that Peterkin was speaking too much, he had merely to tell him
to shut up, when Peterkin instantly collapsed. We noticed one great
change in Peterkin. Formerly, when he came home for the holidays he had
strongly objected to making what he called drawing-room calls, but all
that was changed. Now he went from house to house, showing the captain
off. ""This is Rawlins,"" remained his favorite form of introduction. He
is a boy who can never feel comfortable in a drawing-room, and so the
visits were generally of short duration. They had to go because they
were due in another house in a quarter of an hour, or he had promised to
let Jemmy Clinker, who is our local cobbler and a great cricketer, see
Rawlins. When a lady engaged the captain in conversation, Peterkin did
not scruple to sign to her not to bother him too much; and if they were
asked to call again, Peterkin said he couldn't promise. There was a
remarkable thing the captain could do to a walking stick, which Peterkin
wanted him to do everywhere. It consisted in lying flat on the floor and
then raising yourself in an extraordinary way by means of the stick. I
believe it is a very difficult feat, and the only time I saw our guest
prevailed upon to perform it he looked rather apoplectic. Sometimes he
would not do it, apparently because he was not certain whether it was a
dignified proceeding. He found it very hard, nevertheless, to resist the
temptation, and it was the glory of Peterkin to see him yield to it.
From certain noises heard in Peterkin's bedroom it is believed that he
is practicing the feat himself."

you not let your wife know that you have been reading? This is another
matter that you never reason about. Perhaps, it is because of your
craving for sympathy, and you fear that if you were seen enjoying a
novel the sympathy would go. Or, perhaps, it is that a holiday in bed is
never perfect without a secret. Monotony must be guarded against, and so
long as you keep the book to yourself your holiday in bed is a healthy
excitement. A stolen book (as we may call it) is like stolen fruit,
sweeter than what you can devour openly. The boy enjoys his stolen
apple, because at any moment he may have to slip it down the leg of his

happily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace,
Elegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than
her Sister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of
Julia’s, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as
estimable. She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness
the most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking. She
appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her
conversation during the half hour they set with us, was replete with
humourous sallies, Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible, the
amiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her
own. Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received
of him. My Father met him with that look of Love, that social Shake,
and cordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and
valued freind from whom thro’ various circumstances he had been
separated nearly twenty years. Mr Millar observed (and very justly too)
that many events had befallen each during that interval of time, which
gave occasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections
on the many changes in their situation which so long a period had
occasioned, on the advantages of some, and the disadvantages of others.
From this subject she made a short digression to the instability of
human pleasures and the uncertainty of their duration, which led her to
observe that all earthly Joys must be imperfect. She was proceeding to
illustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when
the Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father
and Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending
five or six months with us on their return. We of course mentioned you,
and I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all.
“Louisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet
sometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite.
She neither wants Understanding or is without some pretensions to
Beauty, but these are so very trifling, that the value she sets on her
personal charms, and the adoration she expects them to be offered are
at once a striking example of her vanity, her pride, and her folly.” So
said I, and to my opinion everyone added weight by the concurrence of
their own."
"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","""As for that,"" said the Su-dic, again angry, ""I made a law that any of
my people could catch fish in the Lake of the Skeezers, whenever they

life. The delicate fern grew in the conservatory among tea-roses and
camellias, adding grace to every bouquet of which it formed a part,
whether it faded in a ball-room, or was carefully cherished by some poor
invalid's bed-side,--a frail thing, yet with tenacious roots and strong
stem, nourished by memories of the rocky nook where it had learned its
lesson so well. The mountain-laurel clung to the bleak hillside,
careless of wintry wind and snow, as its sturdy branches spread year by
year, with its evergreen leaves for Christmas cheer, its rosy flowers
for spring-time, its fresh beauty free to all as it clothed the wild
valley with a charm that made a little poem of the lovely spot where the
pines whispered, woodbirds sang, and the hidden brook told the sweet
message it brought from the mountain-top where it was born."

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","""Oh, yes."""
"Balzac, Honoré de","The Duke
On the contrary, I should like you to speak out, so that I may know
what secrets you will permit us to keep."
"Austen, Jane","I have received Letters from you and your Mother-in-law within this
week which have greatly entertained me, as I find by them that you are
both downright jealous of each others Beauty. It is very odd that two
pretty Women tho’ actually Mother and Daughter cannot be in the same
House without falling out about their faces. Do be convinced that you
are both perfectly handsome and say no more of the Matter. I suppose
this letter must be directed to Portman Square where probably (great as
is your affection for Lesley Castle) you will not be sorry to find
yourself. In spite of all that people may say about Green fields and
the Country I was always of opinion that London and its amusements must
be very agreable for a while, and should be very happy could my
Mother’s income allow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during
Winter. I always longed particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether
the cold Beef there is cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly
suspicion that few people understand the art of cutting a slice of cold
Beef so well as I do: nay it would be hard if I did not know something
of the Matter, for it was a part of my Education that I took by far the
most pains with. Mama always found me _her_ best scholar, tho’ when
Papa was alive Eloisa was _his_. Never to be sure were there two more
different Dispositions in the World. We both loved Reading. _She_
preferred Histories, and I Receipts. She loved drawing, Pictures, and I
drawing Pullets. No one could sing a better song than she, and no one
make a better Pye than I.—And so it has always continued since we have
been no longer children. The only difference is that all disputes on
the superior excellence of our Employments _then_ so frequent are now
no more. We have for many years entered into an agreement always to
admire each other’s works; I never fail listening to _her_ Music, and
she is as constant in eating my pies. Such at least was the case till
Henry Hervey made his appearance in Sussex. Before the arrival of his
Aunt in our neighbourhood where she established herself you know about
a twelvemonth ago, his visits to her had been at stated times, and of
equal and settled Duration; but on her removal to the Hall which is
within a walk from our House, they became both more frequent and
longer. This as you may suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs Diana who
is a professed enemy to everything which is not directed by Decorum and
Formality, or which bears the least resemblance to Ease and
Good-breeding. Nay so great was her aversion to her Nephews behaviour
that I have often heard her give such hints of it before his face that
had not Henry at such times been engaged in conversation with Eloisa,
they must have caught his Attention and have very much distressed him.
The alteration in my Sisters behaviour which I have before hinted at,
now took place. The Agreement we had entered into of admiring each
others productions she no longer seemed to regard, and tho’ I
constantly applauded even every Country-dance, she played, yet not even
a pidgeon-pye of my making could obtain from her a single word of
approbation. This was certainly enough to put any one in a Passion;
however, I was as cool as a cream-cheese and having formed my plan and
concerted a scheme of Revenge, I was determined to let her have her own
way and not even to make her a single reproach. My scheme was to treat
her as she treated me, and tho’ she might even draw my own Picture or
play Malbrook (which is the only tune I ever really liked) not to say
so much as “Thank you Eloisa;” tho’ I had for many years constantly
hollowed whenever she played, _Bravo_, _Bravissimo_, _her_, _Da capo_,
_allegretto con expressione_, and _Poco presto_ with many other such
outlandish words, all of them as Eloisa told me expressive of my
Admiration; and so indeed I suppose they are, as I see some of them in
every Page of every Music book, being the sentiments I imagine of the
composer."

enlightened without dazzling me; you have given me the experience of

with impunity that you have whetted the edge of my intellect, expanded
my view, roused my perspicacity. Tell me, what is the source of your
wealth, is it an honorable one? Why do you forbid me to confess to you
the sufferings of my childhood? Why have you given me the name of the
village where you found me? Why do you prevent me from searching out
my father and mother? Why do you bow me down under a load of
falsehoods? An orphan may rouse the interest of people; an imposter,
never. I live in a style which makes me a equal to the son of a duke
or a peer; you have educated me well, without expense to the state;
you have launched me into the empyrean of the world, and now they
fling into my face the declaration, that there are no longer such
people as De Frescas in existence. I have been asked who my family
are, and you have forbidden me to answer. I am at once a great
nobleman and a pariah. I must swallow insults which would drive me to
rend alive marquises and dukes; rage fills my heart; I should like to
fight twenty duels, and to die. Do you wish me to suffer any further
insults? No more secrets for me! Prometheus of hell, either finish

SCENE CHANGES TO THE SUN—"
"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Fever--one of your dastard weapons--was no doubt what set me drawing
portraits, but why did I see you a big man with a black beard? Because
long ago, when the world was young, I had a schoolmaster of that
appearance. He crackled his fingers too. I had forgotten him utterly. He
had gone from me with the love of climbing for crows' nests--which I
once thought would never die--but during some of these seventeen days
of thirty-six hours each I suppose I have been a boy again. Yet I had
many schoolmasters, all sure at first that they could make something of
me, all doleful when they found that I had conscientious scruples
against learning. Why do I merge you into him of the crackling fingers?
I know. It is because in mediaeval times I hated him as I hate you. No
others have I loathed with any intensity, but he alone of my masters
refused to be reconciled to my favorite method of study, which
consisted, I remember (without shame) in glancing at my tasks, as I
hopped and skipped to school. Sometimes I hopped and skipped, but did
not arrive at school in time to take solid part in lessons, and this
grieved the soul of him who wanted to be my instructor. So we differed,
as Gladstonian and Conservative on the result of the Parnell Commission,
and my teacher, being in office, troubled me not a little. I confess I
hated him, and while I sat glumly in his room, whence the better boys
had retired, much solace I found in wondering how I would slay him,
supposing I had a loaded pistol, a sword, and a hatchet, and he had only
one life. I schemed to be a dark, morose pirate of fourteen, so that I
might capture him, even at his black-board, and make him walk the plank.
I was Judge Lynch, and he was the man at the end of the rope. I charged
upon him on horseback, and cut him down. I challenged him to single
combat, and then I was Ivanhoe. I even found pleasure in conceiving
myself shouting ""Crackle-fingers"" after him, and then bolting round a
corner. You must see now why I pictured you heavy, and dark, and
bearded. You are the schoolmaster of my later years. I lay in bed and
gloried in the thought that presently I would be up, and fall upon you
like a body of cavalry."

me, saying that he had a headache, but saying it in a cheery way, for he
knew that the root was in the next room. He disappeared into the library
to nibble half an inch of the cio-root, and shortly afterwards we set
off. The headache had been dispelled as usual. In the train he and I had
another argument about the one great drug, and he ridiculed my notion
about its being faith that drove his headache away. I may hurry over the
next two hours, up to the time when we wandered into Buchanan street.

ordinary holiday-maker never gets. How can we be expected to sympathize

mockery; that your child will jam her finger in the railway carriage,
and scream to the end of the journey; that you will lose your luggage;
that the guard will notice your dog beneath the seat, and insist on its
being paid for; that you will be caught in a Scotch mist on the top of a
mountain, and be put on gruel for a fortnight; that your wife will fret
herself into a fever about the way the servant, who has been left at
home, is carrying on with her cousins, the milkman and the policeman;
and that you will be had up for trespassing. Yet, when you tell us you
are off to-morrow, we have never the sympathy to say, ""Poor fellow, I
hope you'll pull through somehow."" If it is an exhibition you go to
gape at, we never picture you dragging your weary legs from one
department to another, and wondering why your back is so sore. Should it

miserable than all the others, it is that spent at the seaside, when you
wander the weary beach and fling pebbles at the sea, and wonder how long
it will be till dinner time. Were we to come down to see you, we would
probably find you, not on the beach, but moving slowly through the
village, looking in at the one milliner's window, or laboriously reading
what the one grocer's labels say on the subject of pale ale, compressed
beef, or vinegar. There was never an object that called aloud for

sulky. The first thing he asked us when we met was whether we had a
headache, and often he clipped off an inch or two of the cio-root and
gave it us in a piece of paper, so that a headache might not take us
unawares. I believe he rather enjoyed waking with a headache, for he
knew that it would not have a chance. If his wife had been a jealous
woman, she would not have liked the way he talked of the cio-root."

Ellinor, and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that
on a close examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have
strictly deserved them. I murdered my father at a very early period of
my Life, I have since murdered my Mother, and I am now going to murder
my Sister. I have changed my religion so often that at present I have
not an idea of any left. I have been a perjured witness in every public
tryal for these last twelve years; and I have forged my own Will. In
short there is scarcely a crime that I have not committed—But I am now
going to reform. Colonel Martin of the Horse guards has paid his
Addresses to me, and we are to be married in a few days. As there is
something singular in our Courtship, I will give you an account of it.
Colonel Martin is the second son of the late Sir John Martin who died
immensely rich, but bequeathing only one hundred thousand pound apeice
to his three younger Children, left the bulk of his fortune, about
eight Million to the present Sir Thomas. Upon his small pittance the
Colonel lived tolerably contented for nearly four months when he took
it into his head to determine on getting the whole of his eldest
Brother’s Estate. A new will was forged and the Colonel produced it in
Court—but nobody would swear to it’s being the right will except
himself, and he had sworn so much that Nobody beleived him. At that
moment I happened to be passing by the door of the Court, and was
beckoned in by the Judge who told the Colonel that I was a Lady ready
to witness anything for the cause of Justice, and advised him to apply
to me. In short the Affair was soon adjusted. The Colonel and I swore
to its’ being the right will, and Sir Thomas has been obliged to resign
all his illgotten wealth. The Colonel in gratitude waited on me the
next day with an offer of his hand—. I am now going to murder my
Sister."

"Austen, Jane","“We are the sons as you already know, of the two youngest Daughters
which Lord St Clair had by Laurina an italian opera girl. Our mothers
could neither of them exactly ascertain who were our Father, though it
is generally beleived that Philander, is the son of one Philip Jones a
Bricklayer and that my Father was one Gregory Staves a Staymaker of
Edinburgh. This is however of little consequence for as our Mothers
were certainly never married to either of them it reflects no Dishonour
on our Blood, which is of a most ancient and unpolluted kind. Bertha
(the Mother of Philander) and Agatha (my own Mother) always lived
together. They were neither of them very rich; their united fortunes
had originally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had always
lived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to
nine Hundred. This nine Hundred they always kept in a Drawer in one of
the Tables which stood in our common sitting Parlour, for the
convenience of having it always at Hand. Whether it was from this
circumstance, of its being easily taken, or from a wish of being
independant, or from an excess of sensibility (for which we were always
remarkable) I cannot now determine, but certain it is that when we had
reached our 15th year, we took the nine Hundred Pounds and ran away.
Having obtained this prize we were determined to manage it with
eoconomy and not to spend it either with folly or Extravagance. To this
purpose we therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we
devoted to Victuals, the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th
to Carriages, the 5th to Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to
Amusements, the 8th to Cloathes and the 9th to Silver Buckles. Having
thus arranged our Expences for two months (for we expected to make the
nine Hundred Pounds last as long) we hastened to London and had the
good luck to spend it in 7 weeks and a Day which was 6 Days sooner than
we had intended. As soon as we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves
from the weight of so much money, we began to think of returning to our
Mothers, but accidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death,
we gave over the design and determined to engage ourselves to some
strolling Company of Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage.
Accordingly we offered our services to one and were accepted; our
Company was indeed rather small, as it consisted only of the Manager
his wife and ourselves, but there were fewer to pay and the only
inconvenience attending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for want of
People to fill the Characters, we could perform. We did not mind
trifles however—. One of our most admired Performances was _Macbeth_,
in which we were truly great. The Manager always played _Banquo_
himself, his Wife my _Lady Macbeth_. I did the _Three Witches_ and
Philander acted _all the rest_. To say the truth this tragedy was not
only the Best, but the only Play that we ever performed; and after
having acted it all over England, and Wales, we came to Scotland to
exhibit it over the remainder of Great Britain. We happened to be
quartered in that very Town, where you came and met your Grandfather—.
We were in the Inn-yard when his Carriage entered and perceiving by the
arms to whom it belonged, and knowing that Lord St Clair was our
Grandfather, we agreed to endeavour to get something from him by
discovering the Relationship—. You know how well it succeeded—. Having
obtained the two Hundred Pounds, we instantly left the Town, leaving
our Manager and his Wife to act _Macbeth_ by themselves, and took the
road to Sterling, where we spent our little fortune with great _eclat_.
We are now returning to Edinburgh in order to get some preferment in
the Acting way; and such my Dear Cousin is our History.”"

Chapter Twenty-Four"
"Austen, Jane","You ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable—I
will now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms.
She is short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a
good deal; has fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let
you know as soon as she sees you, and is altogether very pretty. She is
remarkably good-tempered when she has her own way, and very lively when
she is not out of humour. She is naturally extravagant and not very
affected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from
me, and never writes anything but her answers to them. She plays, sings
and Dances, but has no taste for either, and excells in none, tho’ she
says she is passionately fond of all. Perhaps you may flatter me so far
as to be surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection
should be my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our
freindship arose rather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine.
We spent two or three days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom
we both happened to be connected—. During our visit, the Weather being
remarkably bad, and our party particularly stupid, she was so good as
to conceive a violent partiality for me, which very soon settled in a
downright Freindship and ended in an established correspondence. She is
probably by this time as tired of me, as I am of her; but as she is too
Polite and I am too civil to say so, our letters are still as frequent
and affectionate as ever, and our Attachment as firm and sincere as
when it first commenced. As she had a great taste for the pleasures of
London, and of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some
difficulty in prevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I
dare say she feels of beholding you, at the expence of quitting those
favourite haunts of Dissipation, for the melancholy tho’ venerable
gloom of the castle you inhabit. Perhaps however if she finds her
health impaired by too much amusement, she may acquire fortitude
sufficient to undertake a Journey to Scotland in the hope of its
Proving at least beneficial to her health, if not conducive to her
happiness. Your fears I am sorry to say, concerning your father’s
extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers Jewels and your Sister’s
consequence, I should suppose are but too well founded. My freind
herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably spend nearly as
much every year in Dress and Public places, if she can get it—she will
certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the manner of living
to which he has been so long accustomed, and there is therefore some
reason to fear that you will be very well off, if you get any fortune
at all. The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be hers, and
there is too much reason to think that she will preside at her Husbands
table in preference to his Daughter. But as so melancholy a subject
must necessarily extremely distress you, I will no longer dwell on it—."

brought a small wicker bag, containing various requirements of sorcery,
and from this she took a parcel of powder and a vial of liquid. She
poured the liquid into the skeropythrope and added the powder. At once
the skeropythrope began to sputter and emit sparks of a violet color,
which spread in all directions. The Sorceress instantly stepped into

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","A few years ago, if any one in Fleet street had said that the day would
come when I would devote my time to trying to lose my reputation, I
would have smiled incredulously. That was before I had a reputation. To
be as statistical as time will allow--for before I go to bed I have
seven and a half yards of fiction to write--it took me fifteen years'
hard work to acquire a reputation. For two years after that I worked as
diligently to retain it, not being quite certain whether it was really
there, and for the last five years I have done my best to get rid of it.
Mr. R. L. Stevenson has a story of a dynamiter who tried in vain to
leave an infernal machine anywhere. It was always returned to him as
soon as he dropped it, or just as he was making off. My reputation is as
difficult to lose. I have not given up the attempt yet, but I am already
of opinion that it is even harder to lose a reputation in letters than
to make one. My colleagues will bear me out in this."

the wide intervale below. A brook went babbling among the stones and
grass and sweet-ferns, while all the slope was rosy with laurel-flowers

I cannot say much for this Monarch’s sense. Nor would I if I could, for
he was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars between him
and the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had
better read some other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in
this, meaning by it only to vent my spleen _against_, and shew my
Hatred _to_ all those people whose parties or principles do not suit
with mine, and not to give information. This King married Margaret of
Anjou, a Woman whose distresses and misfortunes were so great as almost
to make me who hate her, pity her. It was in this reign that Joan of
Arc lived and made such a _row_ among the English. They should not have
burnt her—but they did. There were several Battles between the Yorkists
and Lancastrians, in which the former (as they ought) usually
conquered. At length they were entirely overcome; The King was
murdered—The Queen was sent home—and Edward the 4th ascended the
Throne."
"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","""I now remember,"" returned Aujah, ""that one of the arts we taught
Coo-ee-oh was the way to expand steel, and I think that explains how
the island is raised and lowered. I noticed in the basement a big steel
pillar that passed through the floor and extended upward to this
palace. Perhaps the end of it is concealed in this very room. If the
lower end of the steel pillar is firmly embedded in the bottom of the
lake, Coo-ee-oh could utter a magic word that would make the pillar
expand, and so lift the entire island to the level of the water."""

It would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were
not as well acquainted with the particulars of this King’s reign as I
am myself. It will therefore be saving _them_ the task of reading again
what they have read before, and _myself_ the trouble of writing what I
do not perfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the
principal Events which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked
Cardinal Wolsey’s telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that “he
was come to lay his bones among them,” the reformation in Religion and
the King’s riding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is
however but Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was
entirely innocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of
which her Beauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient
proofs, not to mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the
weakness of the Charges against her, and the King’s Character; all of
which add some confirmation, tho’ perhaps but slight ones when in
comparison with those before alledged in her favour. Tho’ I do not
profess giving many dates, yet as I think it proper to give some and
shall of course make choice of those which it is most necessary for the
Reader to know, I think it right to inform him that her letter to the
King was dated on the 6th of May. The Crimes and Cruelties of this
Prince, were too numerous to be mentioned, (as this history I trust has
fully shown;) and nothing can be said in his vindication, but that his
abolishing Religious Houses and leaving them to the ruinous
depredations of time has been of infinite use to the landscape of
England in general, which probably was a principal motive for his doing
it, since otherwise why should a Man who was of no Religion himself be
at so much trouble to abolish one which had for ages been established
in the Kingdom. His Majesty’s 5th Wife was the Duke of Norfolk’s Neice
who, tho’ universally acquitted of the crimes for which she was
beheaded, has been by many people supposed to have led an abandoned
life before her Marriage—of this however I have many doubts, since she
was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the
Queen of Scotland’s cause, and who at last fell a victim to it. The
Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with difficulty effected
it. He was succeeded by his only son Edward."

When Peterkin, who is twelve, wrote to us that there was a possibility

leg-balls over the pavilion and was said to have made a joke to the
head-master's wife. By-and-by we understood the distinction that was to
be conferred on us. Peterkin instructed his mother to send the captain a
formal invitation addressed ""J. Rawlins, Esq."" This was done, but in
such a way that Peterkin feared we might lose our distinguished visitor.
""You shouldn't have asked him for all the holidays,"" Peterkin wrote, ""as
he has promised a heap of fellows."" Then came a condescending note from
the captain, saying that if he could manage it he would give us a few

Peterkin wrote shortly afterwards asking his sister Grizel to send him
her photograph. ""If you haven't one,"" he added, ""what is the color of
your eyes?"" Grizel is eighteen, which is also, I believe, the age of J.

exceedingly fair of skin; the one who had been a bronzefish had dark
brown hair and clear gray eyes and her complexion matched these lovely

secretly tried to discover their arts of magic. In this she was more
clever than anyone suspected. She invited the three Adepts to a banquet
one day, and while they were feasting Coo-ee-oh stole their charms and
magical instruments and transformed them into three fishes--a gold
fish, a silver fish and a bronze fish. While the poor fishes were
gasping and flopping helplessly on the floor of the banquet room one of
them said reproachfully: 'You will be punished for this, Coo-ee-oh, for
if one of us dies or is destroyed, you will become shrivelled and
helpless, and all your stolen magic will depart from you.' Frightened

warn you against suffering yourselves to be meanly swayed by the
Follies and Vices of others, for beleive me my beloved Children that if
you do—I shall be very sorry for it.” They both assured me that they
would ever remember my advice with Gratitude, and follow it with
attention; That they were prepared to find a World full of things to
amaze and to shock them: but that they trusted their behaviour would
never give me reason to repent the Watchful Care with which I had
presided over their infancy and formed their Minds—” “With such
expectations and such intentions (cried I) I can have nothing to fear
from you—and can chearfully conduct you to Mrs Cope’s without a fear of
your being seduced by her Example, or contaminated by her Follies.
Come, then my Children (added I) the Carriage is driving to the door,

enjoy.” When we arrived at Warleigh, poor Augusta could scarcely
breathe, while Margaret was all Life and Rapture. “The long-expected
Moment is now arrived (said she) and we shall soon be in the World.”—In
a few Moments we were in Mrs Cope’s parlour, where with her daughter
she sate ready to receive us. I observed with delight the impression my
Children made on them—. They were indeed two sweet, elegant-looking
Girls, and tho’ somewhat abashed from the peculiarity of their
situation, yet there was an ease in their Manners and address which
could not fail of pleasing—. Imagine my dear Madam how delighted I must
have been in beholding as I did, how attentively they observed every
object they saw, how disgusted with some Things, how enchanted with
others, how astonished at all! On the whole however they returned in
raptures with the World, its Inhabitants, and Manners."

“I have a Relation in Scotland (said Sophia to me as we left London)
who I am certain would not hesitate in receiving me.” “Shall I order

exclaimed, “Alas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the Horses.”
Unwilling however to act only from my own inadequate Knowledge of the
Strength and Abilities of Horses, I consulted the Postilion, who was
entirely of my Opinion concerning the Affair. We therefore determined
to change Horses at the next Town and to travel Post the remainder of
the Journey—. When we arrived at the last Inn we were to stop at, which
was but a few miles from the House of Sophia’s Relation, unwilling to
intrude our Society on him unexpected and unthought of, we wrote a very
elegant and well penned Note to him containing an account of our
Destitute and melancholy Situation, and of our intention to spend some
months with him in Scotland. As soon as we had dispatched this Letter,
we immediately prepared to follow it in person and were stepping into
the Carriage for that Purpose when our attention was attracted by the
Entrance of a coroneted Coach and 4 into the Inn-yard. A Gentleman
considerably advanced in years descended from it. At his first
Appearance my Sensibility was wonderfully affected and e’er I had gazed
at him a 2d time, an instinctive sympathy whispered to my Heart, that
he was my Grandfather. Convinced that I could not be mistaken in my
conjecture I instantly sprang from the Carriage I had just entered, and
following the Venerable Stranger into the Room he had been shewn to, I
threw myself on my knees before him and besought him to acknowledge me
as his Grand Child. He started, and having attentively examined my
features, raised me from the Ground and throwing his Grand-fatherly
arms around my Neck, exclaimed, “Acknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance
of my Laurina and Laurina’s Daughter, sweet image of my Claudia and my
Claudia’s Mother, I do acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and
the Grandaughter of the other.” While he was thus tenderly embracing
me, Sophia astonished at my precipitate Departure, entered the Room in
search of me. No sooner had she caught the eye of the venerable Peer,
than he exclaimed with every mark of Astonishment—“Another
Grandaughter! Yes, yes, I see you are the Daughter of my Laurina’s
eldest Girl; your resemblance to the beauteous Matilda sufficiently
proclaims it. “Oh!” replied Sophia, “when I first beheld you the
instinct of Nature whispered me that we were in some degree related—But
whether Grandfathers, or Grandmothers, I could not pretend to
determine.” He folded her in his arms, and whilst they were tenderly
embracing, the Door of the Apartment opened and a most beautifull young
Man appeared. On perceiving him Lord St. Clair started and retreating
back a few paces, with uplifted Hands, said, “Another Grand-child! What
an unexpected Happiness is this! to discover in the space of 3 minutes,
as many of my Descendants! This I am certain is Philander the son of my
Laurina’s 3d girl the amiable Bertha; there wants now but the presence
of Gustavus to compleat the Union of my Laurina’s Grand-Children.”"

suggested authors, and explained whatever puzzled them. Very happy bits
of time were these, and very precious to both, as Emily learned to see

undiminished constancy, notwithstanding he has been dead more than six

afterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and

not see Ozma and Dorothy as they sped past and descended the steps.
Then they had to go up five steps and down another ten, and so on, in
the same manner in which they had climbed to the top of the mountain.
Ozma lighted their way with her wand and they kept on without relaxing

"Austen, Jane","We arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already
heartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square
for such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this. You can form no
idea sufficiently hideous, of its dungeon-like form. It is actually
perched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible, that I
expected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented
having gratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of
being obliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a
manner. But as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside
of this tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having
my spirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the
Miss Lesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh. But here again,
I met with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise. Matilda and
Margaret Lesley are two great, tall, out of the way, over-grown, girls,
just of a proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison
as themselves. I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these
Scotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits. They
will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to
accompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight.
Besides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who
I beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave
me a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss _Somebody_ which I
have entirely forgot. I hate scandal and detest Children. I have been
plagued ever since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of
Scotch wretches, with terrible hard-names; they were so civil, gave me
so many invitations, and talked of coming again so soon, that I could
not help affronting them. I suppose I shall not see them any more, and
yet as a family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do
with myself. These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no Drawings
but Scotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems—and I hate
everything Scotch. In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett
with a great deal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there
is not a creature in the House whom I have any wish to please. I have
just had a conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly
offended me, and which as I have nothing more entertaining to send you
I will gave you the particulars of. You must know that I have for these
4 or 5 Days past strongly suspected William of entertaining a
partiality to my eldest Daughter. I own indeed that had _I_ been
inclined to fall in love with any woman, I should not have made choice
of Matilda Lesley for the object of my passion; for there is nothing I
hate so much as a tall Woman: but however there is no accounting for
some men’s taste and as William is himself nearly six feet high, it is
not wonderful that he should be partial to that height. Now as I have a
very great affection for my Brother and should be extremely sorry to
see him unhappy, which I suppose he means to be if he cannot marry
Matilda, as moreover I know that his circumstances will not allow him
to marry any one without a fortune, and that Matilda’s is entirely
dependant on her Father, who will neither have his own inclination nor
my permission to give her anything at present, I thought it would be
doing a good-natured action by my Brother to let him know as much, in
order that he might choose for himself, whether to conquer his passion,
or Love and Despair. Accordingly finding myself this Morning alone with
him in one of the horrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause
to him in the following Manner."
"Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank)","""If you want to make peace,"" said the Su-dic, ""make the Skeezers

ill-feeling. I learned by accident that Urquhart, on the strength of the
lady's letter, had stated for a fact to his comrades that she was going
to send him a cake. He had also taken Fleming Secundus to a
pastry-cook's in the vicinity of the school, and asked him to turn his
eyes upon a cake which had the place of honor in the centre of the
window. Secundus admitted with a sigh that it was a beauty. Without
comment Urquhart led him to our local confectioner's, and pointed out
another cake. Secundus again passed favorable criticism, the words he
used, I have reason to believe, being ""Oh, Crikey!"" By this time
Urquhart had exhausted the shops of an interesting kind in our
neighborhood, and he and his companion returned to the school. For a
time Urquhart said nothing, but at last he broke the silence. ""You saw
yon two cakes?"" he asked Secundus, who replied, with a smack of the
lips, in the affirmative. ""Then let me tell you,"" said Urquhart,
solemnly, ""that the two of them rolled together don't come within five
miles of the cake I'm to get on my birthday."" Tremendous news like this
spreads through a school like smoke, and Urquhart was courted as he had
never been before. One of the most pitiful cases of toadyism known to me
was witnessed that very day in the foot-ball field. I was playing in a
school match on the same side as Urquhart and a boy called Cocky Jones
by his associates because of his sublime impertinence to his master.
While Urquhart was playing his shoelace became loosened, and he stooped
to tie it. ""I say, Urquhart,"" cried Cocky, ""let me do that for you!"" It
will thus be seen, taking one thing with another, that Urquhart's
confidence in the old lady had raised high hopes. ""Is this the day
Urquhart gets his cake?"" the ""fellows"" asked each other. Consider their
indignation when he got, instead, ""Thoughtful Boys Make Thoughtful Men.""
Secundus refused to speak to him; Williamson, Green, Robbins, Tosh and
others scowled as if he had stolen their cake; Cocky Jones kicked him

your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you have my grateful
Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I every day more regret the serene and
tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange for the
uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City. Not that I will
pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements are in
the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them
extremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that
every appearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those
unhappy Beings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho’ it is
out of my power to return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my
sensibility for the sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike
of the extreme admiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so
celebrated both in Public, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops,
that are the reasons why I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so
various and pleasing of London. How often have I wished that I
possessed as little Personal Beauty as you do; that my figure were as
inelegant; my face as unlovely; and my appearance as unpleasing as
yours! But ah! what little chance is there of so desirable an Event; I
have had the small-pox, and must therefore submit to my unhappy fate."

finding itself strangely confined to the spot began to back and snarl
angrily. They couldn't hear the barkings and snarls, but they could see
the creature's mouth open and its thick lips move. Button Bright,
however, being but a few feet away from the wolf, heard its cries of
rage, which wakened him from his untroubled sleep. The boy sat up and
looked first at the tiger and then at the wolf. His face showed that
for a moment he was quite frightened, but he soon saw that the beasts
were unable to approach him and so he got upon his feet and examined
them curiously, with a mischievous smile upon his face. Then he
deliberately kicked the tiger's head with his foot and catching up a
fallen branch of a tree he went to the wolf and gave it a good
whacking. Both the beasts were furious at such treatment but could not

"Austen, Jane","She told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of
Nature, her curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in
that part of the World had been so much raised by Gilpin’s Tour to the
Highlands, that she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to
Scotland and had persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them. That they
had arrived at Edinburgh a few Days before and from thence had made
daily Excursions into the Country around in the Stage Coach they were
then in, from one of which Excursions they were at that time returning.
My next enquiries were concerning Philippa and her Husband, the latter
of whom I learned having spent all her fortune, had recourse for
subsistence to the talent in which, he had always most excelled,
namely, Driving, and that having sold every thing which belonged to
them except their Coach, had converted it into a Stage and in order to
be removed from any of his former Acquaintance, had driven it to
Edinburgh from whence he went to Sterling every other Day. That
Philippa still retaining her affection for her ungratefull Husband, had
followed him to Scotland and generally accompanied him in his little
Excursions to Sterling. “It has only been to throw a little money into
their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my Father has always travelled
in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the Country since our arrival in
Scotland—for it would certainly have been much more agreable to us, to
visit the Highlands in a Postchaise than merely to travel from
Edinburgh to Sterling and from Sterling to Edinburgh every other Day in
a crowded and uncomfortable Stage.” I perfectly agreed with her in her
sentiments on the affair, and secretly blamed Sir Edward for thus
sacrificing his Daughter’s Pleasure for the sake of a ridiculous old
woman whose folly in marrying so young a man ought to be punished. His
Behaviour however was entirely of a peice with his general Character;
for what could be expected from a man who possessed not the smallest
atom of Sensibility, who scarcely knew the meaning of simpathy, and who

priests had no fixed fee, and charged according to circumstances. If
business was slack and the bridegroom not pressing, they lowered their
charges, but where the bribed post-boys told them of high rank, hot
pursuit, and heavy purses, they squeezed their dupes remorselessly. It

when we were sitting down between the dances, she came to me with
_more_ than her usual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and
said loud enough to be heard by half the people in the room, “Pray Miss

I cannot agree whether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder.” I saw that she
wanted to mortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent

he?” “I beleive not Ma’am.” “Did not he abscond?” “I never heard that

“Why, was not your _Father_ as poor as a Rat” “I fancy not.” “Was not
he in the Kings Bench once?” “I never saw him there.” She gave me

delighted with myself for my impertinence, and half afraid of being
thought too saucy. As Lady Greville was extremely angry with me, she
took no further notice of me all the Evening, and indeed had I been in
favour I should have been equally neglected, as she was got into a
Party of great folks and she never speaks to me when she can to anyone
else. Miss Greville was with her Mother’s party at supper, but Ellen

This amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to
those of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve
since he was her descendant. Never certainly were there before so many
detestable Characters at one time in England as in this Period of its
History; never were amiable men so scarce. The number of them
throughout the whole Kingdom amounting only to _five_, besides the
inhabitants of Oxford who were always loyal to their King and faithful
to his interests. The names of this noble five who never forgot the
duty of the subject, or swerved from their attachment to his Majesty,
were as follows—The King himself, ever stedfast in his own
support—Archbishop Laud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke
of Ormond, who were scarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause.
While the _villains_ of the time would make too long a list to be
written or read; I shall therefore content myself with mentioning the
leaders of the Gang. Cromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be
considered as the original Causers of all the disturbances, Distresses,
and Civil Wars in which England for many years was embroiled. In this
reign as well as in that of Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my
attachment to the Scotch, to consider them as equally guilty with the
generality of the English, since they dared to think differently from
their Sovereign, to forget the Adoration which as _Stuarts_ it was
their Duty to pay them, to rebel against, dethrone and imprison the
unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to deceive, and to sell the no less
unfortunate Charles. The Events of this Monarch’s reign are too
numerous for my pen, and indeed the recital of any Events (except what
I make myself) is uninteresting to me; my principal reason for
undertaking the History of England being to Prove the innocence of the
Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself with having effectually done,
and to abuse Elizabeth, tho’ I am rather fearful of having fallen short
in the latter part of my scheme.—As therefore it is not my intention to
give any particular account of the distresses into which this King was
involved through the misconduct and Cruelty of his Parliament, I shall
satisfy myself with vindicating him from the Reproach of Arbitrary and
tyrannical Government with which he has often been charged. This, I
feel, is not difficult to be done, for with one argument I am certain
of satisfying every sensible and well disposed person whose opinions
have been properly guided by a good Education—and this Argument is that
he was a STUART."

prove irresistible to the couples who, on getting married on the Scotch

You don't attempt to catch your hat as it were on the wing. You walk
after it, smiling, as if you liked the joke the more you think of it,
and confident that the hat will come to rest presently. You are not the
sort of man to make a fuss over a hat. You won't give the hat the
satisfaction of thinking that it can annoy you. Strange though it may
seem, there are idiots who will join you in pursuit of the hat. One will
hook it with a stick, and almost get it, only not quite. Another will
manage to hit it hard with an umbrella. A third will get his foot into
it or on it. This does not improve the hat, but it shows that there is a
good deal of the milk of human kindness flowing in the street as well
as water, and is perhaps pleasant to think of afterwards. Several times
you almost have the hat in your possession. It lies motionless, just
where it has dropped after coming in contact with a hansom. Were you to
make a sudden rush at it you could have it, but we have agreed that you
are not that sort of man. You walk forward, stoop, and----. One reads
how the explorer thinks he has shot a buffalo dead, and advances to put
his foot proudly on the carcass, how the buffalo then rises, and how the
explorer then rises also. I have never seen an explorer running after
his hat (though I should like to), but your experience is similar to his
with the buffalo. As your hand approaches the hat, the latter turns over
like a giant refreshed, and waddles out of your reach. Once more your
hand is within an inch of it, when it makes off again. There are ringing
cheers from the audience on the pavement, some of them meant for the
hat, and the others as an encouragement to you. Before you get your hat
you have begun to realize what deer-stalking is, and how important a
factor is the wind."

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Dreary pleasure, you say, breakfasting alone in a half-furnished house,
with the snow lying some feet deep outside and still monotonously
falling. Do I forget the sound of my own voice between Monday and
Saturday? I should think not. Nor do I forget Janet's voice. I have read
somewhere that the Scotch are a very taciturn race, but Janet is far
more Scotch than the haggis that is passed around at some London
dinners, and Janet is not a silent woman. The difficulty with some
servants is to get them to answer your summons, but my difficulty with
Janet is to get her back to the kitchen. Her favorite position is at the
door, which she keeps half open. One of her feet she twists round it,
and there she stands, half out of the room and half in it. She has a
good deal of gossip to tell me about those five houses that lie low, two
hundred yards from the manse, and it must be admitted that I listen. Why
not? If one is interested in people he must gossip about them. You, in
London, may not care in the least who your next door neighbor is, but
you gossip about your brothers and sisters and aunts. Well, my people
are as familiar to me as your brothers are to you, and, therefore, I
say, ""Ah, indeed,"" when told that the smith is busy with the wheel of a
certain farmer's cart, and ""Dear me, is that so?"" when Janet explains
that William, the ploughman, has got Meggy, his wife, to cut his hair.
Meggy has cut my own hair. She puts a bowl on my head and clips away
everything that it does not cover. So I would miss Janet if she were
gone, and her tongue is as enlivening as a strong ticking clock. No
doubt there are times when, if I were not a minister, I might fling
something soft at her. She shows to least advantage when I have
visitors, and even in winter I have a man to dinner now and again. Then
I realize that Janet does not know her place. While we are dining she
hovers in the vicinity. If she is not pretending to put the room to
rights, she is in her fortified position at the door; and if she is not
at the door she is immediately behind it. Her passion is to help in the
conversation. As she brings in the potatoes she answers the last remark
my guest addressed to me, and if I am too quick for her she explains
away my answer, or modifies it, or signifies her approval of it. Then I
try to be dignified and to show Janet her place. If I catch her eye I
frown, but such opportunities are rare, for it is the guest on whom she
concentrates herself. She even tells him, in my presence, little things
about myself which I would prefer to keep to myself. The impression
conveyed by her is that I confide everything to her. When my guest
remarks that I am becoming a hardened bachelor, and I hint that it is
because the ladies do not give me a chance, Janet breaks in with--"

back, and a glittering drop trembling from his nose, picked his way
through the puddles, his lips pursed into a portentous frown, and his
grey head bowed professionally in contemplation of a pair of
knock-knee'd but serviceable shanks. A noteworthy man Willum, son of
Simon, son of David, grandson by marriage of Joseph Paisley, all famous
""blacksmiths"" of Gretna Green. For nigh a century Springfield has marked
time by the Langs, and still finds ""In David Lang's days"" as forcible as
""when Plancus was consul."" Willum's predecessors in office reserved
themselves for carriage runaways, and would shake the lids from their
coffins if they knew that Willum had to marry the once despised
""pedestrians."" ""Even Elliot,"" David Lang would say, ""could join couples
who came on foot,"" and that, of course, was very hard on the poor
pedestrian, for greater contempt no man ever had for rival than David
for Elliot, unless, indeed, it was Elliot's for David. But those were
the great clattering days, when there were four famous marrying shops:
the two rival inns of Springfield, that washed their hands of each other
across the street, Mr. Linton's aristocratic quarters at Gretna Hall,
and the toll-bar on the right side of the Sark. A gentleman who had
requisitioned the services of the toll-keeper many years ago recently
made a journey across the border to shake his fist at the bar, and no
one in Gretna Green can at all guess why. Far-seeing Murray, the
sometime priest of Gretna Hall, informed me, succeeded Beattie at the
toll-house in 1843, and mighty convenient friends in need they both
proved for the couples who dashed across the border with foaming fathers
at their coaches' wheels. The stone bridge flashed fire to rushing
hoofs, the exulting pursuers, knowing that a half-mile brae still barred
the way to Springfield, saw themselves tearing romantic maidens from
adventurers' arms, when Beattie's lamp gleamed in the night, the horses
stopped as if an invisible sword had cleft them in twain, the maid was
whisked like a bundle of stolen goods into the toll-bar, and her father
flung himself in at the door in time to be introduced to his son-in-law.
Oh, Beattie knew how to do his work expeditiously, and fat he waxed on
the proceeds. In his later days marrying became the passion of his life,
and he never saw a man and a maid together without creeping up behind
them and beginning the marriage service. In Springfield there still are
men and women who have fled from him for their celibacy, marriage in
Scotland being such an easy matter that you never know when they may not
have you. In joining couples for the mere pleasure of the thing, Simon
brought high fees into disrepute, and was no favorite with the rest of
the priesthood. That half-mile nearer the border, Jardine admits, gave
the toll-bar a big advantage, but for runaways who could risk another
ten minutes, Gretna Hall was the place to be married at."

in flannel, procured at the hotel. He had the rugs and my great coat
over his legs, but he shivered despite them, and when he spoke at all,
except to say that he was feeling worse every minute, it was to talk of
men cut off in their prime and widows left destitute. At Mrs.
Montgomery's wish, I telegraphed from a station at which the train
stopped to the family doctor in Edinburgh, asking him to meet us at the

piercing squeals in his ears, but he did not wince. The green-and-red
lizard, coming from the window-sill, approached Ervic and began
spitting a flaming fluid at him, but Ervic merely stared at the
creature and its flame did not touch him."
"Alcott, Louisa May","She talked long with the girls, and gave them the counsel all eager
young people need, yet are very slow to accept till experience teaches
them its worth. As the friend of many successful literary people, Mrs.
Spenser was constantly receiving the confidences of unfledged
scribblers, each of whom was sure that he or she had something valuable
to add to the world's literature. Her advice was always the same, ""Work
and wait;"" and only now and then was a young poet or author found enough
in earnest to do both, and thereby prove to themselves and others either
that they _did_ possess power, or did not, and so settle the question
forever. ""First live, then write,"" proved a _quietus_ for many, and ""Do
the duty that lies nearest"" satisfied the more sincere that they could
be happy without fame. So, thanks to this wise and kindly woman, a large
number of worthy youths and maidens ceased dreaming and fell to work,
and the world was spared reams of feeble verse and third-rate romances."

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","Carlyle is the only author by whom Mr. Barrie thinks he has been
influenced. The Carlyle fever did not last very long, but was acute for
a time. He fervently defended his master against the innumerable critics
called into activity by Mr. Froude's biography. Apart from this,
Dumfries seems to have left no very definite mark on his mind. The only
one of his teachers who impressed him was Dr. Cranstoun, the
accomplished translator from the Latin poets, and he rather indirectly
than directly. In the Dumfries papers Mr. Barrie inaugurated his
literary career by contributing accounts of cricket matches and letters,
signed ""Paterfamilias,"" urging the desirability of pupils having longer
holidays. He was the idlest of schoolboys, and seldom opened his books
except to draw pictures on them."

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","It remains to follow the inglorious career of this copy of ""Thoughtful
Boys make Thoughtful Men."" First, Urquhart was openly contemptuous of
it, and there seemed a probability of its only being used as a missile.
Soon, however, he dropped hints that it was a deeply interesting story,
following these hints up with the remark that he was open to offers. He
and Fleming Secundus had quite a tiff about it, though they are again
good friends. Secundus, it appears, had gone the length of saying that
it was worth a shilling, and had taken it to his bed to make sure of
this. Urquhart considered it as good as bought, but Secundus returned it
to him next day. Examination of the book roused the suspicions of
Urquhart, who charged Secundus with having read it by peeping between
the pages, which, to enhance its commercial value, had remained uncut.
This Secundus denied, but he had left the mark of his thumb on it.
Eventually the book was purchased by Cocky Jones, but not without a row.
Cocky went up to Urquhart one day and held out a shilling, saying that
he would give it for ""Thoughtful Boys Make Thoughtful Men."" The owner
wanted to take the shilling at once, and give up the book later in the
day, but Cocky insisted on its being put into his hands immediately.
That Jones should be anxious to become the possessor of an improving
book surprised Urquhart, but in his haste to make sure of the shilling,
he handed over ""Thoughtful Boys Make Thoughtful Men."" Within an hour of
the striking of this bargain a rumor reached Urquhart's ears that Cocky
had resold the work for one and sixpence. Inquiries were instituted,
which led to a discovery. At our school there is a youth called Dicky
Jenkinson, who, though not exactly a thoughtful boy, has occasional
aspirations in that direction. Being for the moment wealthy, Jenkinson
had remarked, in the presence of Cocky, that one and sixpence would not
be too much to give for Urquhart's copy of ""Thoughtful Boys Make
Thoughtful Men."" Feeling his way cautiously, Cocky asked whether he
meant that the book would be cheap at one and sixpence to anybody who
wanted it, or whether he (Dicky) was willing and able to expend that sum
on it. Thus brought to bay, Jenkinson solemnly declared that he meant to
make Urquhart an offer that very day. Cocky made off to think this
matter over, for he was aware that the book had been already offered to
Fleming Secundus for a shilling. He saw that by taking prompt action he
might clear sixpence before bedtime. Unfortunately, he was not able to
buy the book from Urquhart, for he was destitute of means, and he knew
it would be mere folly to ask Urquhart for credit. In these painful
circumstances he took Robbins into his confidence. At first he merely
asked Robbins to lend him a shilling, and Robbins merely replied that he
would do no such thing. To show that the money would be returned
promptly, Cocky then made a clean breast of it, after which Robbins was
ready to lend him an ear. Robbins, however, stipulated that he should
get half of the spoils."

We returned a suitable answer to this affectionate Note and after
thanking her for her kind invitation assured her that we would
certainly avail ourselves of it, whenever we might have no other place
to go to. Tho’ certainly nothing could to any reasonable Being, have
appeared more satisfactory, than so gratefull a reply to her
invitation, yet I know not how it was, but she was certainly capricious
enough to be displeased with our behaviour and in a few weeks after,
either to revenge our Conduct, or releive her own solitude, married a
young and illiterate Fortune-hunter. This imprudent step (tho’ we were
sensible that it would probably deprive us of that fortune which
Philippa had ever taught us to expect) could not on our own accounts,
excite from our exalted minds a single sigh; yet fearfull lest it might
prove a source of endless misery to the deluded Bride, our trembling
Sensibility was greatly affected when we were first informed of the
Event. The affectionate Entreaties of Augustus and Sophia that we would
for ever consider their House as our Home, easily prevailed on us to
determine never more to leave them, In the society of my Edward and
this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest moments of my Life; Our time
was most delightfully spent, in mutual Protestations of Freindship, and
in vows of unalterable Love, in which we were secure from being
interrupted, by intruding and disagreable Visitors, as Augustus and
Sophia had on their first Entrance in the Neighbourhood, taken due care
to inform the surrounding Families, that as their happiness centered
wholly in themselves, they wished for no other society. But alas! my
Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then enjoyed was too perfect to be
lasting. A most severe and unexpected Blow at once destroyed every
sensation of Pleasure. Convinced as you must be from what I have
already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that there never were
a happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that their union had
been contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel and Mercenery Parents;
who had vainly endeavoured with obstinate Perseverance to force them
into a Marriage with those whom they had ever abhorred; but with a
Heroic Fortitude worthy to be related and admired, they had both,
constantly refused to submit to such despotic Power."

"Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew)","To enjoy your holiday in bed to the full, you should let it be vaguely
understood that there is something amiss with you. Don't go into
details, for they are not necessary; and, besides, you want to be dreamy
more or less, and the dreamy state is not consistent with a definite
ailment. The moment one takes to bed he gets sympathy. He may be
suffering from a tearing headache or a tooth that makes him cry out; but
if he goes about his business, or even flops in a chair, true sympathy
is denied him. Let him take to bed with one of those illnesses of which
he can say with accuracy that he is not quite certain what is the matter
with him, and his wife, for instance, will want to bathe his brow. She
must not be made too anxious. That would not only be cruel to her, but
it would wake you from the dreamy state. She must simply see that you
are ""not yourself."" Women have an idea that unless men are ""not
themselves"" they will not take to bed, and as a consequence your wife is
tenderly thoughtful of you. Every little while she will ask you if you
are feeling any better now, and you can reply, with the old regard for
truth, that you are ""much about it."" You may even (for your own
pleasure) talk of getting up now, when she will earnestly urge you to
stay in bed until you feel easier. You consent; indeed, you are ready to
do anything to please her."

was directed to the corner in which I sat. “Oh! my Isabel (continued I

to him by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a
Closet for him, provided he would take a small house near the borders
of an extensive Forest, and about three Miles from the Sea. Wilhelminus

girls write verses and think they are poets; but it is only a passing
mood, and fortunately for the world, and for them also, it soon dies out
in some more genuine work or passion. Very few have the real gift, and
those to whom it _is_ given wait and work and slowly reach the height of
their powers. Many delude themselves, and try to persuade the world that
they can sing; but it is waste of time, and ends in disappointment, as
the mass of sentimental rubbish we all see plainly proves. Write your
little verses, my dear, when the spirit moves,--it is a harmless
pleasure, a real comfort, and a good lesson for you; but do not neglect
higher duties or deceive yourself with false hopes and vain dreams.
'First live, then write,' is a good motto for ambitious young people. A
still better for us all is, 'Do the duty that lies nearest;' and the
faithful performance of that, no matter how humble it is, will be the
best help for whatever talent may lie hidden in us, ready to bloom when
the time comes. Remember this, and do not let my enthusiastic girl's

he has ever felt any for me.” said Janetta. “That he certainly adores
you (replied Sophia) there can be no doubt—. The Attachment must be
reciprocal. Did he never gaze on you with admiration—tenderly press
your hand—drop an involantary tear—and leave the room abruptly?” “Never
(replied she) that I remember—he has always left the room indeed when
his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly abruptly
or without making a bow.” Indeed my Love (said I) you must be
mistaken—for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left
you but with Confusion, Despair, and Precipitation. Consider but for a
moment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose
that he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person.” Having
settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into
consideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform
